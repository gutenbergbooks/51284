<h2 class="fs240">THE<br />
WAYS OF THE PLANETS</h2>



<h2>I</h2>

<h3>ON MAKING ACQUAINTANCE WITH THE PLANETS</h3>


<p>It is sought in the following pages to give
a simple account of what may now be said
to be known of the character of the planets,
and to describe with as little technicality as
possible their movements and aspects and relations.
An endeavor is made to impart concerning
each one of them not, surely, profound
learning, but just a good, every-day,
practical notion, so that the mere name will
call up a definite object, with its own attributes,
appearance, and behavior, entirely
distinct from any other planet or from any
other object in the skies.</p>

<p>An endeavor is made also to so simplify<span class="pagenum" title="2"><a name="Page_2" id="Page_2"></a></span>
and direct the observation that any one, after
a little practice, will know almost without
hesitation, on seeing a planet in the sky, that
it is a planet, and not a fixed star, and exactly
what planet it is. The situation and aspect
of it will then as quickly and clearly pronounce
it to be the individual planet that it
is as the sight of a person of one’s acquaintance
proclaims him to be that person, and no
other. The very name of Venus, for example,
and still more the sight of Venus, will call
up a conception of Venus, with the particular
atmosphere and light and movements and
wanderings which make her what she is. On
looking at her the observer will at once know
why she occupies the special position in the
sky in which he sees her, why she is not so
bright as she was when she was last in view,
or is so much brighter than she was then,
about how long she is likely to remain where
she is, and when she goes what will become
of her.</p>

<p>For far off and truly mysterious as the
planets are, it still is with them as with most
other objects in nature: a very little knowledge
of their aspects and their ways begets
a sense about them that makes the most
casual observation of them interesting and,<span class="pagenum" title="3"><a name="Page_3" id="Page_3"></a></span>
as far as it goes, intelligent. The slightest
glance at them betrays some shape, or position,
or light, or other quality, which at once
makes recognition of them unmistakable.
They disclose themselves oftentimes, one can
scarcely say how, just as persons with whom
we are intimate do by some half-caught
outline, motion, or posture; or just as the
trees do to an observer who knows, for example,
an oak-tree from an elm, whether they
are covered with their own peculiar verdure,
or whether they stand with bare branches
stretched out and colored in their own
peculiar way.</p>

<p>This instant recognition of the planets is,
of course, not to be had by simply reading
about them. Such practical familiarity with
them is attained only by seeking them out
over and over again and looking at them with
attention, with eagerness, and with all one’s
faculty. With them, as with other natural
objects, it requires observation truly to know
them. But then, observation, when one gets
a little started in it, is a great deal more
interesting, a great deal more absorbing, than
any reading about them can ever be. It is
also a very easy thing to begin, for, after all,
it is not much more than looking and then<span class="pagenum" title="4"><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4"></a></span>
looking again. In doing this one can hardly
tell just when an object ceases to be
strange, and then becomes familiar, and
finally is so much a part of every-day knowledge
that one knows it at a glance. But
this is what happens in the case of any
natural object when we observe it often and
with true attention.</p>

<p>In the case of the planets, if one is interested
at all, every stage in the cultivation
of such an acquaintance is full of pleasure.
Even to one who regards them only as a
part of the general aspect of the sky, they
are the most beautiful objects in it and
always the first to attract special attention.
Nine times out of ten, when any one asks
what a certain star is, it proves to be one
of the planets. When one of them is visible
a person can hardly glance at the heavens
without noticing it, even if he does not stop
to think about it. But if he does stop to
think about it and notices that it is far
larger than any star he has noted before,
that it hangs low in the western sky early
in the evening, and shines with a brilliant
silvery light, and if he then learns that it
is Venus, will he not always have a pleasant
thrill of recognition when he again sees such<span class="pagenum" title="5"><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5"></a></span>
a star in such a position and knows it as
Venus, among the planets as surpassing in
beauty as the goddess of that name was
among the immortals? Or, if in the east,
at the same time in the evening, he sees a
brilliant, solid-looking, unblinking star shining
with a white light, but pinkish white, not
silvery, and finds it to be Jupiter, will not such
a star in such a situation be to him ever
after a pleasant acquaintance that he can
call by name? Not that Jupiter and Venus
are always in these positions, or shine in
just this way at all times. These are their
places and aspects at certain times, frequently
recurring, and at such times always
unmistakably distinguish them.</p>

<p>It is, then, merely the matter of a little
more and yet a little more observation, in
order to come to know any one of the visible
planets in all its varying aspects and
situations. Of course, at the start some guidance
is necessary, but only a little; and that
little, if it is of the right sort, should not be
irksome. To provide such guidance is one
of the aims of this book. That is, indeed,
its main aim.</p>

<p>But in addition to what, as a help in observation,
it may find to say regarding the<span class="pagenum" title="6"><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6"></a></span>
appearance and movements of the planets,
it will endeavor to give also ample information
concerning their character and constitution.</p>

<p>It is hoped that this may be done without
weighting the narrative with figures, though
some of the peculiarities of the planets must
be expressed by means of numbers. Certainly
no mathematical problems will be
presented. But it will be profitable to
remember that every one of the intimate
things we know about the planets has come
to us through the long and laborious mathematical
work of astronomers. To them we
owe the extinguishable debt that we owe to
all special workers who put us in possession
of the facts that interpret life to us.</p>

<p>For the astrology and poetry and romance
of the planets one must go elsewhere.
Nearly every book on the subject of the
planets&mdash;and there are many of them&mdash;has
some information about these things; and
properly, too, for every genuine emotion
and every real fancy has its value. But
neither curious lore of the planets nor the
sentiment and emotion they have produced
in others is what the author of this book
is striving to set forth. It is something much<span class="pagenum" title="7"><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7"></a></span>
more vital than this. What we wish to
contemplate here are the plain facts, the
knowledge of which enlivens and enriches
one’s mind and nature. If the contemplation
of them kindles one’s fancy or excites
one’s emotions, these results at least will
not be second-hand. If the bare facts,
simply and plainly told, and the view of
the planets themselves as they wander
through their courses in the sky, do not
awaken one’s understanding and imagination,
no amount of poetry or romance that
other people have built up around the
planets will arouse anything more than a
factitious interest in them. It is when our
own faculties are at work and our own fancy
plays over a subject that we become genuinely
and lastingly interested in it.</p>

<p>The facts themselves are in the main quite
simple, and will not be given here as anything
else than that. They have been fairly
wrested from that mysterious thing called
space by the mighty power of mind and unceasing
labor. Our knowledge of them is
due to long nights of watching and long
days of calculating; to long and careful
testing and considering of theories, only to
find that something else must be tried; to<span class="pagenum" title="8"><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8"></a></span>
courage to begin all over again, to sudden
inspirations, and sometimes to those lucky
discoveries that seem almost like miracles.</p>

<p>The subject of the planets has in some respects
a greater interest even than that of
the stars, because we know, after all, more
about them. We sometimes have a feeling,
though, that we know more of the stars, although
the stars are so much farther off.
Why we have this feeling it is easy to explain.
Knowing them to be so far removed from us,
we really approach the stars with a different
expectation. The few things that we have
learned about them have in themselves such
a magnitude that it makes them seem a
greater body of knowledge than they truly
are. The stars are indeed so far away, and
what we know of them has to be expressed
in such large terms, that the mind does not
demand in that information the minute exactness
that it seeks for in the case of nearer
objects.</p>

<p>In the case of the stars, we seek mainly to
know their distances, the direction of their
motions, the speed with which they travel,
and their probable connection with each
other. The fact that in computing the distance
of a single star, many trillions of miles<span class="pagenum" title="9"><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9"></a></span>
away, the result may be a little less than
exact does not keep us from learning what
ones are sufficiently near for their distances
to be measured at all and what ones are immeasurably
remote. Whether they travel at
the rate of exactly three or three hundred
miles a second, we can learn that some are
traveling at somewhat the same rate of speed
as our sun travels, and some incredibly faster;
that certain groups are going in one direction
and certain groups in another; that some are
approaching us and some are receding from
us. And thus we can classify them and learn
the significance of these facts, and, little by
little, gain a definite understanding of the
construction and meaning of the entire universe.
Their very remoteness gives a certain
compactness to the information we have
about the stars, by making it necessary to
generalize more than we would if they were
near enough to yield more details; and we
are in a way satisfied with this more general
sort of knowledge of them.</p>

<p>But the very fact of our knowing so much
about the planets extends our curiosity concerning
them and makes us feel that we ought
to know more. The mind is provoked into
more minute speculations about them, and<span class="pagenum" title="10"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10"></a></span>
we demand more exactness of information
and knowledge of a more specific or intimate
sort than would satisfy us in regard to the
stars. Atmosphere, habitability, exact size,
seasons, and day and night, are the kind of
things we most seek to know in reference to
the planets. These are such definite things
that conclusions concerning them are subject
to close criticism, and differences of opinion
in regard to them thus sometimes occur
which tend to give one a more or less confused
notion of what is really known. As a
matter of fact, our information about the
planets is much fuller than our knowledge
of the stars, as we would naturally expect it
to be. Much of what we seek to know about
the stars has long been common knowledge
about the planets.</p>

<h3>OUR RELATION TO THE PLANETS</h3>


<p>To know about the planets is to know
about ourselves. The earth is one of
them. Whatever their origin, the earth’s is
the same. It and they are formed from the
same nebula, controlled by the same central
body, subject to the same laws, and destined
for the same fate in the end. In this, the
stars and the planets are not alike. They all
shine upon us with the same sweet friendliness,
and commonly we make no difference
between them in our feeling for them. But
the stars are bright and beautiful acquaintances
living far away in their own domain.
The planets are members of our own family,
bone of our bone and flesh of our flesh, living
comparatively near to us, within the domain
of our common source of life, the sun.</p>

<p>One evening last autumn I was coming
up Broadway, New York, with a friend, when
we encountered at Union Square a man with<span class="pagenum" title="12"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12"></a></span>
a six-inch telescope directed toward the eastern
sky. He was soliciting those who passed
to stop and look at Mars and Saturn. Both
of these planets were then very bright.
They were also fairly near together, and so
low in the east that one could scarcely help
seeing them. But the people passed back
and forth with hardly so much as a glance at
the man and his telescope, and for the most
part never even raised their eyes to the sky
with a passing curiosity to see what it might
be that he wanted to show them. My friend
and I stopped and took each a view first of
Mars and then of Saturn. While we were
looking at the planets, a few of the passers-by
began to loiter about, half smiling at us for
so playing in public, slightly curious to see
how we were faring at it, but for the most
part apparently indifferent to what we were
seeing. We had a fine view of Saturn lightly
resting in his nest of rings, and an equally
good view of the comical “eye” of Mars.</p>

<p>After we had finished, one or two others,
evidently prompted by our example, followed
us at the telescope. One or two inquired
of us what the stars were that had
so interested us, and one, pointing to Mars,
wanted to know if it was Venus. As the<span class="pagenum" title="13"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13"></a></span>
crowd grew larger a few more ventured to
take a look, much as they might venture
to take their chance at hitting the bull’s-eye
in some shooting-gallery. With the
telescope pointed at Saturn, the man droningly
chanted: “This planet is 887,000,000
miles from the sun. The ring you see is
170,000 miles in diameter,” and so on.
These, to be sure, were the facts&mdash;and most
marvelous facts, too&mdash;but without much
meaning to one who knows nothing much
about the planets; and the manner of their
recital certainly did not make them alluring.
I could not myself help feeling that
the people there were missing a valuable
opportunity, and that it would be only fair
to them for some one fairly to cry out:
“Come here and look at this planet. It is
different from anything else you have ever
seen or ever will see. It was at one time
a part of the same nebulous mass that we
were a part of. It is in the same system of
worlds with us. It was formed in the same
way that this world was formed. It is in
itself the most wonderful thing you ever
saw, and it is bound, as we are, to the sun
by the ever-drawing tie of gravitation. The
very position of our own world in space is<span class="pagenum" title="14"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14"></a></span>
more or less influenced by it. If anything
should happen to it, it might be a serious
matter to us.”</p>

<p>For it is true that we are thus closely
bound to the planets. The family tie among
us is of far more force and significance than
in any ordinary case of common origin.
Human family ties wear, as we know, often
into the merest threads, or even become no
ties at all. But that between the earth and
the planets remains apparently as close and
strong as ever it was. The law of gravity,
under which the earth draws toward its center
every atom of matter surrounding it, and
thus holds together all the atoms composing
it, is not solely terrestrial in its application.
It is probably universal. It certainly applies
to every part of our little family of
worlds. Every particle in the solar system
attracts toward it every other particle in
that system with a force determined by its
mass and its distance. The sun, by reason
of its immense size, compels the earth and all
the other planets forever to circle around it.
But the planets themselves have just as much
power of attraction as the sun, atom for atom.</p>

<p>Thus, while the sun controls the motions
of all of them, each pulls at the other, and,<span class="pagenum" title="15"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15"></a></span>
according to its power, determines how much
the path of each shall vary from the course
around the sun it otherwise would make.
In the case of the smaller planets, this
gravitational influence is, of course, very slight,
and so subtle that we here on earth are not
even conscious of it. But it is, nevertheless,
real and continuous. It is greatest between
the two largest planets, Jupiter and Saturn;
but it was enough in the case of Uranus and
Neptune to lead, by its mere manifestation
on the earth, to the discovery of Neptune,
the farthest planet.</p>

<p>Being thus of the same origin with the
planets, having the same life history, being
bound to them in space by a tie that is perhaps
eternal, how can we fail to have the
most intimate interest in their nature and
all that concerns them?</p>

<p>But in addition to their close relationship
to us there is, to make them of peculiar
interest, the fact that, after the sun and the
moon, they are for our eyes the most splendid
objects in all the brilliant panorama of
the sky. Such of them as we can see at
all with the naked eye are most of the time
much brighter than any first-magnitude
star. As they wander from constellation to<span class="pagenum" title="16"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16"></a></span>
constellation the soft light of their placid faces
gives a beauty and variety to the spectacle
that endears them to us, and at the same
time enhances by contrast their own charm
and that of the glittering, unchanging stars.</p>

<p>There is nothing that gives one such a
sense of sweet familiarity with the heavens
as a really recognizing acquaintance with
the planets. They are not, like the stars,
associated with particular seasons. They
come sometimes with the gay company of
stars that dance their way across the cold
winter skies, and sometimes with those that
shine during the soft summer nights. Often
in the spring and autumn we see some one
of them before the sun is fairly down, and,
before the light of an ordinary star can yet
be seen, hanging in lone brilliancy as the
evening star; and often an early riser has
the reward of seeing one as a morning star
glowing almost in the rays of the rising sun.
Thus they are, one and another, with us at
all times and seasons, and it accords with the
fact of the relation being a family one that
we have in their coming and going a sense
of frequency and informality which we cannot
have in the more regular and seasonal
coming and going of the stars.</p>

<h2>III</h2>

<h3>WHAT THE PLANETS ARE, AND WHAT
THEY APPEAR TO BE</h3>


<p>The planets are dark, opaque bodies
which revolve at varying distances and
at varying rates of speed in orbits more or
less circular around the sun as a center.
They have no light of their own, as the
stars have, but shine wholly by reflected
light received from the sun, which itself is
a star. The amount of light they show to
us depends upon their size, their distance,
and their power of reflecting the light they
receive.</p>

<p>In comparison with the stars, the planets
are very near to us. Our sun, which is in
constitution a star, but very widely separated
from any other star in the universe,
holds all his family of planets by the tether
of gravitation, and so keeps them circling
about him in a very small space, as astronom<span class="pagenum" title="18"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18"></a></span>ical
space is measured. To all of the planets
except Mercury, we ourselves are nearer
than the sun is. To be sure, this distance
between us and the planets, as measured
by any terrestrial measure, is not exactly
small. It is only by comparison that we
can be said to have anything like a cozy
relation to them. For merely earthly affairs
we use terrestrial measures. In solar affairs
we measure by an astronomical unit, which
is the sun’s distance from the earth, ninety-three
millions of miles. When we say a
planet’s distance from the sun is thirty
astronomical units, we mean it is thirty
times farther than the earth is from the
sun.</p>

<p>For matters outside of the solar system,
the unit of measure is the number of miles
that light travels in a year. The speed of
light is a little more than 186,000 miles in
a second. This is equal to about six trillions
of miles in a year, or about sixty-three
thousand times the distance of the sun
from the earth, our family measuring-stick.
From the nearest star it takes light more
than four years to come to us. From the
nearest planet light comes in less than
three minutes, and from the farthest one it<span class="pagenum" title="19"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19"></a></span>
makes the journey in a little more than four
hours.</p>

<p>As compared with other heavenly bodies,
therefore, the sun and the planets are very
near together, occupying a very small space
in the immensity of the universe, immeasurably
isolated from all the other systems and,
so far as we know, immeasurably smaller as
a system than most of them.</p>

<p>The whole body of the planets is divided
according to size into two classes, the major
and the minor planets. When we refer
generally to the planets, the major planets
only are meant. The minor planets are
usually called the asteroids, or planetoids.
There are many hundreds of them, and only
one&mdash;and that barely&mdash;can be seen with the
naked eye. The other planets are eight in
number, including the earth, which is, after
all, nothing but one of the smaller of the
major planets. They are, in the order of
their distances from the sun: Mercury, the
nearest, Venus, the Earth, Mars, Jupiter,
Saturn, Uranus, and Neptune. Of these
only five&mdash;Mercury, Venus, Mars, Jupiter,
and Saturn&mdash;can be seen from the earth without
optical aid. Occasionally, when Uranus
is very favorably situated, a person with an<span class="pagenum" title="20"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20"></a></span>
exceptionally good eye, who knows exactly
where to look for the planet, can see it.
Neptune is about equal to an eighth-magnitude
star in brightness, and can never be
seen without the aid of a telescope. Mercury,
while quite bright enough to be seen,
is not often situated favorably for observation.
It is very near the sun, and is generally
obscured either by the light of the sun
when the sun and the planet are above the
horizon, or by the haziness of the atmosphere
when the sun is below the horizon
and the planet a little above it. In regions
of considerable altitude with a clear, rare
atmosphere, Mercury is more often seen;
but never for very long at a time.</p>

<p>The only planets, therefore, that are a
part of our evening spectacle in the skies
are Venus, Mars, Jupiter, and Saturn.
These four happen to be not only the ones
we oftenest see, but also the most interesting
of all the planets from various points
of view. Venus and Mars are the nearest
to the earth, and most resemble it, and hence
are the most inviting for speculations which
have a human interest, such as habitability,
the presence of life, and kindred ideas.
Jupiter and Saturn are interesting above all<span class="pagenum" title="21"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21"></a></span>
the others in their splendor and size, and
in their importance as the centers of systems
of their own.</p>

<p>As seen by us, the planets are similar to
the stars, but with very distinct differences
in appearance, which, when once familiar,
mark them so unmistakably as planets, and
not fixed stars, that we need never get the
two confused. The first and easiest distinguishing
mark to notice is that they do
not twinkle, as the stars do, but shine with
a steady light similar to that of the moon.
This is an invariable difference between
stars and planets, and one needs only to
stop and truly look at them in order to detect
it. And once it has become familiar,
it discloses itself at a glance.</p>

<p>This difference between stars and planets
is due almost solely to difference of distance,
though the twinkling is caused by our own
atmosphere. The stars are too far away
to send us anything but a mere point of
light, and the unequal density of the waves
of air sweeping over this point of light keeps
it dancing before our eyes, causing the
phenomenon that we call twinkling. But
the planets, being nearer to us, show a disc,
from every point of which comes a line of<span class="pagenum" title="22"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22"></a></span>
light, making the total light of some volume;
and these inequalities of the air are too small
to interfere with it to any extent. Sometimes,
when the atmosphere is particularly
unsteady, it happens that the light of a
planet is somewhat affected by it when the
planet is just rising or setting and is, consequently,
near the horizon, and that it then
seems to twinkle a little. But this departure
from the rule is always slight and of
short duration, in the case of the four
planets most seen. Mercury, never being
seen anywhere except near the horizon,
often seems to twinkle; but then he is seldom
seen at all, and, when visible, is in other
ways so well marked that one cannot fail
to recognize him.</p>

<p>So the steady light may justly be said to
be invariable, because the unusual conditions
are easily detected. When the atmosphere
is such as to cause even the planets
to blink a little, it has an effect also on the
stars. At such a time they will appear to
be fairly dancing. This effect is apt to
occur on the clear nights of winter, the
atmosphere being more unsteady then. Such
nights, because of the extreme liveliness and
brilliancy that they lend to the stars, are<span class="pagenum" title="23"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23"></a></span>
attractive times for amateur observations.
For the astronomer, however, they are not
so favorable. For the seeing of small details
such as he seeks, the steadiest atmosphere
is necessary.</p>

<p>Though the planets are near enough to
show a disc, they are not sufficiently near
to show to the naked eye as sharp an outline
as the moon’s. Usually the edge is
more or less rayed like that of a fixed star,
which adds somewhat to the difficulty of
distinguishing them from the stars until
their aspect has become familiar to us. The
fact that we are looking at a disc is plainly
shown when an occultation by the moon
occurs. When the moon occults a fixed
star, it passes between us and the star.
At such times the star disappears behind
the edge of the moon instantly, as a mere
point naturally would. When a planet is
occulted by the moon, it disappears gradually
as the moon covers more and more of its
disc, thus showing unmistakably the nature
of it.</p>

<p>After steadiness of shining, the next most
obvious mark of difference between a planet
and a star, from our point of view, is the
movement of the planets. A star remains<span class="pagenum" title="24"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24"></a></span>
always in one place with relation to the other
stars, while the planets move about from
constellation to constellation, seeming to
travel sometimes toward the east and sometimes
toward the west.</p>

<p>This difference also is due solely to a difference
of distance. The stars as well as the
planets are constantly in motion. Most of
them, in truth, move at a rate which would
make the rate of motion of a planet a mere
snail’s pace in comparison. Arcturus, for
instance, is supposed to be moving at the
rate of two or three hundred miles a second,
and there are other fixed stars with an
equally rapid motion. The swiftest moving
of the planets does not achieve much more
than twenty-nine miles a second, while the
slowest swings along at a rate of but little
more than three miles in the same length of
time.</p>

<p>These are the real rates of speed of the stars
and planets; but they are not at all what they
seem to us. The difference in distance is so
great that for centuries and centuries the
flying stars have seemed to men to remain
in the same place in the skies, and so we call
them fixed. The planets, so slow-journeying
as they are in comparison, seem to us<span class="pagenum" title="25"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25"></a></span>
to be moving among the constellations at
rates varying from more than a degree a
day in the swiftest to between two and three
degrees a year in the slowest.</p>

<p>Hence, if through lack of practice in observation
a person is not at once able to distinguish
the difference between the stars
and the planets in the character of their
light&mdash;that is, whether they twinkle or shine
steadily&mdash;he can, by taking a little longer
time, at most only a few days, determine
whether the object he sees is a star or a
planet by noticing whether it has any
motion among the other stars. Venus and
Mars will show some movement in one evening.
Jupiter and Saturn may require a little
more time to disclose their motion.</p>

<h2>IV</h2>

<h3>THE ORIGIN OF THE PLANETS</h3>


<p>Different as the planets are as individuals,
they have too many characteristics
in common to admit any question
of their common origin. They are not
simply stars of one sort and another that
happen to lie nearer to us than the great
body of stars that spangle the heavens,
but are, without doubt, all of one family with
us in their origin, as well as in their situation.
How they originated, and exactly what has
been their course of evolution, has long been
an engrossing problem among philosophers;
and it is not yet solved.</p>

<p>In the sense that the human race is all of
one family, the planets are but a part of the
great universe that lies about us and is in
part visible to us. The forms in which we
know matter as existing in the universe,
outside of the solar system and of the minor
forms in our own world, are those of stars<span class="pagenum" title="27"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27"></a></span>
and nebulæ. It seems as if either of these
could, and in fact does, form out of the other.
We do not at all know how in the beginning
matter took the form of either, or which
came first. But it is believed that a star
is formed by the condensation of a nebula,
and that a nebula is often formed by the collision
or near approach of two stars and the
consequent disintegration of their particles.</p>

<p>The sun is a star not very different from
most of the other stars, as we believe them
to be, except that it is smaller than most of
them. It is the center around which we
and all the planets revolve, and it is believed
that we were all once a part of the very body
of it. For astronomers are substantially
agreed that the whole solar family, including
the sun and all the planets, has been evolved
from a great nebula which, in one form or
another, at one time filled practically the
whole of the immense space from the sun
to the outermost planet of the system.
While this cannot be said to have been exactly
proved, yet it accords with all the known
facts of the solar system. As to how this
nebula originated, and what its shape was,
and in just what way the planets were formed
from it, there is more diversity of opinion.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" title="28"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28"></a></span></p>

<p>Up to the middle of the eighteenth century
no really scientific theory of the evolution
of the solar system was formulated, and it
was not until the very last years of that
century that any theory of the origin of the
planets was published which received anything
like universal acceptance.</p>

<p>This was the case, however, with the famous
nebular hypothesis of Laplace, which was published
in 1796, and for a time seemed so nearly
to account for the various phenomena of the
motions and relations of the planets that it
was not only accepted in the scientific world,
but became almost as much a part of universal
knowledge as that the earth is round.
But even this theory has not completely
stood the test of time, which inevitably
brings that close scientific investigation that
any theory must undergo when it is used as
a working basis to which all facts and secondary
theories must be correlated.</p>

<p>The original nebular hypothesis supposed
this vast nebula to be in rotation on its axis.
As it condensed, the falling-in of the particles
caused its rotation to become more rapid,
until finally, under the strain of this, a ring
of matter was “thrown off” from the outer
edge. Or, as was sometimes said, the inner<span class="pagenum" title="29"><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29"></a></span>
part condensed and left a detached ring of
matter. This ring, continuing to rotate in
the direction given it by the rotation of the
central mass, finally condensed into a planet,
rotating on its axis and revolving about the
central sun in the same direction as the ring
had revolved. The satellites of the planets
were thought to have been formed by the
same process from the planets while these
were still in a plastic state. Saturn, with
its wonderful system of rings and satellites,
was thought to be a minute object-lesson of
a planet in course of evolution, and this we
have often heard said.</p>

<p>I am sorry it is not so. I had much enthusiasm
in my youth over this beautiful
and orderly arrangement of things: first,
the splendid hypothesis, the achievement of
a noble mind; then the little model showing
the work in its progress; and, finally, the beautifully
finished system, the rings all rolled up
into planets, traveling unceasingly in paths
which eternally marked the size of the central
body, or sun, at the time of the separation.</p>

<p>But it is now pretty certain that this cannot
be the way it all happened. Closer investigation
shows that there are mechanical
difficulties which were not at first fully<span class="pagenum" title="30"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30"></a></span>
recognized. A series of rings could not have
been left off by a body so wholly gaseous.
The particles composing them would not be
sufficiently coherent to permit of separation
in any such compact, uniform, and decisive
manner. Then, even if such a ring were
thrown off, it is not at all certain that it
could condense into a planet. Its tendency,
indeed, would be to disintegrate rather than
to condense. In a body so tenuous the mutual
gravitation of its particles would be too
feeble to complete the work. Besides, in conflict
with the theory is the fact that a few
of the satellites of the planets revolve in a
direction contrary to that of the planet. And
there are other minor, but still important,
details in the mechanism of the solar system
which cannot be accounted for by the ring
theory.</p>

<p>And so, while astronomers are still agreed
that the whole solar system, which includes
the planets, was evolved from a primeval
nebula, the theory of leaving off rings which
condensed into planets is not found tenable,
and the search for some more acceptable
theory or some modification of the Laplace
theory is now occupying a number of eminent
astronomers and philosophers.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" title="31"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31"></a></span></p>

<p>The result of all this is that no theory of
the manner of the evolution of the planets
is definitely accepted by the body of astronomers.
Much hard labor and ingenious reasoning
have been expended in endeavoring
to formulate some hypothesis by means of
which we may account for observed phenomena.
The astronomers with whom these
theories have originated are, naturally, more
or less ardent in setting them forth. Thus
one occasionally sees a decisive and authoritative
statement of a theory of the evolution
of the planets that seems at first view to account
for everything. But no one of these has
yet been entirely accepted by astronomers,
who are as a class cautious and conservative,
and are necessarily critical of any theory,
because the value of much of their future
work depends upon its accuracy and sufficiency
for all details.</p>

<p>The theory which at present seems more
nearly than any other to offer a reasonable
explanation of most planetary phenomena
is based upon the supposition that the nebula
from which the sun and planets were evolved
was in the shape of a spiral, and not the
gaseous mass that the original nebular hypothesis
supposed. The fact that among<span class="pagenum" title="32"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32"></a></span>
the many thousands of nebulæ that have
been discovered and observed a very large
proportion of them are in this form, aside
from any other consideration, suggests a
great probability that the one from which
the solar system was evolved was a spiral.</p>

<p>The spiral nebulæ seem to be of a somewhat
different constitution from the other
nebulæ, and show on observation spots of
condensation here and there, which at least
suggest the formation of systems of planets.
This indicates that ours may be only one of
many such systems in process of evolution;
but it is certainly among the smallest of
them, for most of the spiral nebulæ are immensely
greater in size than the one required
to form our little system. Its few trillions
of miles of diameter, though it seems so
vast to us, is quite insignificant in comparison
with a large proportion of the spiral
nebulæ in the universe.</p>

<p>A spiral nebula is in the form of a disc
somewhat resembling that familiar form of
fireworks known as a pinwheel. The typical
form of it has two arms projecting from opposite
sides of the whirling figure. It is
much denser toward the center, where the
spiral would naturally be more tightly<span class="pagenum" title="33"><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33"></a></span>
wound, and has smaller spots of condensation
scattered like knots here and there
along the fiery arms. In the process of
evolution the denser center becomes the
controlling sun, and the smaller spots of
condensation form the planets, which are
eventually detached from the revolving
mass, but continue to revolve about the
center as they were doing from the beginning.
According to the mass it has in the beginning,
the planet gathers up by gravitative
attraction all the material in its region, gaseous
or more or less condensed, and grows
by this accretion. If the nucleus happened
to be a large one before it separated from
the parent body, it will have sufficient force
of gravitation to gather in large quantities
of material and greatly increase its size, and
thus become a large planet. If it is only a
small nucleus, it has less power of attraction,
and gathers in less material.</p>

<p>When these condensations of matter which
are the nuclei of the planets break away from
the parent body, they sometimes carry with
them still smaller nuclei, which, if they are
not too near the original center, or sun, are
destined to remain under the control of the
planets and become their satellites. The<span class="pagenum" title="34"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34"></a></span>
number and size of the satellites a planet has
depends upon the size, and hence the controlling
force, of the nucleus which is its
foundation, and also upon the number of
spots of condensation that chanced to be
formed in its neighborhood sufficiently near
to come under the gravitational control of
the planet. If by any chance the nucleus
which was to form the largest satellite of
Jupiter had been in the situation of Mercury,
for instance, it might well have given
its allegiance to the sun, instead of to
Jupiter, and thus have become a planet.</p>

<p>Under the ring theory the outermost
planet, Neptune, would be the oldest of the
planet family, and the one nearest the sun,
Mercury, would be the latest born and youngest.
But the physical development of these
planets seems to indicate, in truth, exactly
the opposite of this, as we shall see later on.
Under the spiral-nebula theory the planets
may be nearly of the same age, their different
states of development being due mainly
to difference in size and to some peculiarities
of situation. If the nucleus happened to be
near the outer edge of the spiral, it would
be formed from the lighter matter composing
the outer part of the nebula, and this seems<span class="pagenum" title="35"><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35"></a></span>
to be the case with the outer planets. If it
were near the dense center of the nebula, it
would be composed of denser material, and
this seems to be so in the case of the inner
planets.</p>


<p class="mt2em">A nebula, it is thought, is formed by the
collision or the near approach of two of the
many stars, or suns, that we know are
traveling about at high velocities as vagrants
here and there through space. If
the two bodies come together centrally, the
force of the impact will generate heat sufficient
to convert them into a nebula; but
this will not necessarily be spiral in form.
If they come together obliquely, the chances
are that they will form into a rapidly rotating
spiral disc.</p>

<p>But in order to form a spiral, it is not
necessary that there should be an actual
collision. Because of the force of gravitation
the near approach of two stars would
subject them to an enormous strain from
their pull upon each other, and there is a
limit within which they cannot approach
without being literally torn to pieces from
the effect of this tidal force. Even if they
do not approach within this fatal limit,<span class="pagenum" title="36"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36"></a></span>
which is a little less than two and one-half
times the radius of the body, they may come
so near as to change their character entirely,
and, through their tidal influence on each
other, form into a rotating spiral nebula
with two arms projecting from opposite
sides of the spiral.</p>

<p>It now seems probable that it was after
this manner that the sun and its family of
planets were formed. The matter which is
contained in them may have been in the
form of a dark, solid body pursuing some sort
of course in space. In its journeying it came
near another body and was awakened into
a life of activity in the form of a flat, spiral
nebula which was left spinning around in a
pyrotechnic manner, the matter composing
it much diffused at the outer edges and densest
in the center. Scattered through it were
the more or less condensed spots which were
the embryonic forms destined to come forth
from the parent body as the individual
planets.</p>

<p>When the separation was completed, each
planet fed and grew upon all the matter that
it had the force to draw to it, and it swept
clean the space that lay within the limits
of its power. If the particles thus gathered<span class="pagenum" title="37"><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37"></a></span>
in were small and slow of motion, they became
a part of the body of the planet. If
they were large and swift, they became
members of the planet’s family as satellites.
In whatever area of the nebula each planet
came into a separate existence, it fed upon
the matter which that area afforded. In
the case of Neptune, at the outer edge of
the system, it was very diffuse matter; in
Mercury’s region, nearer the center, it was
more dense.</p>

<p>Thus in our family of planets, though its
members were born of the same parent and
developed under the same guiding laws,
each has a distinct individuality arising
from its inherent qualities and its environment
during the early stages of its existence.
The spiral-nebula theory seems to offer a
better explanation of these individual qualities
than any other that has been advanced
thus far, and in its main features it is pretty
generally accepted. But one must keep in
mind that the details of any theory of the
beginning and growth of the planets are
more or less speculative, or, at least, have not
yet been proved with finality.</p>

<h3>THE SEVEN GREAT PLANETS</h3>


<p>So far as we know, five of the planets&mdash;Mercury,
Venus, Mars, Jupiter, and
Saturn&mdash;have been known from time immemorial.
There are existing records of
them made thousands of years ago. There
is no reason why they should not have been
thus known, since they have always been
as they are now, visible to the naked eye,
and all of them save Mercury are as easily
seen as the sun or the moon. They do not,
of course, exact the instant attention that
those great luminaries do, because, being
smaller, they are less isolated from the great
body of the stars; but they are in their
seasons plainly visible, and can then always
be seen if one looks at them.</p>

<p>In ancient times, when people lived more
out-of-doors than is the habit now, they did
look at them. The same primitive shepherds
that, while tending their flocks at<span class="pagenum" title="39"><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39"></a></span>
night on the hills, named the constellations
according to the fanciful shapes that the
unchanging stars seemed to outline, watched
also the five wandering stars, more wonderful
to them than any of the others. They
observed how mysteriously these stars came
at certain seasons and silently threaded their
way across the shining heavens, and then as
mysteriously disappeared. They saw them
not only differing from the other stars in
glory, but changing in their own brilliancy
from one time to another, until, in some cases,
they failed to recognize them as the same
stars under varying aspects. Venus, for
instance, they called Phosphorus, or Lucifer,
when they saw her as a morning star, and
Hesperus, or Vesper, when she shone in the
evening.</p>

<p>The sun and the moon, they noted, also
moved from place to place among the fixed
stars, and they called all these errant bodies
planets, which means “wanderers.” These
are the “seven planets” referred to in the
earlier literatures and in all early books
on astronomy or astrology. This is sometimes
a little confusing, because, though the
sun and the moon are no longer called
planets, we still (omitting the earth) have<span class="pagenum" title="40"><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40"></a></span>
seven. But Neptune and Uranus, not being
visible to the naked eye, were not known
to the ancients. They were discovered by
means of the telescope, and that only within
the last century and a half. So, owing to
these comparatively new-found members of
the solar family, we have yet the magic
number of planets, seven.</p>

<p>These seven are the major planets and the
ones with which mainly it will be our endeavor
here to promote and strengthen an
acquaintance. With Uranus and Neptune
the acquaintance will necessarily be less intimate
than with the others, because we cannot
see them in the same free way; but
they are not on this account much less interesting
than the others, and a little knowledge
of them is pleasant family history.
They simply do not live within sight.</p>

<p>The planets that are nearer to the sun
than we are, and hence lie between us and
the sun, are called the inferior, or sometimes
interior, planets. Those that lie outside
the orbit of the earth are called the superior,
or the exterior, planets. In so grouping
them the earth is the dividing-point, and is
not itself in either class. Mercury and
Venus are the inferior planets. The superior<span class="pagenum" title="41"><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41"></a></span>
planets are Mars, Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus,
and Neptune. The distinction has importance,
especially when we are discussing the
planets with relation to their movements,
as seen from the earth, because the planets
with orbits between us and the sun (the inferior
planets) have very different phases
and apparent motions from those whose
orbits are beyond us from the sun (the superior
planets).</p>

<p>When considered in regard to size, constitution,
development, and their likeness to
each other, the planets are sometimes distinguished
as the terrestrial planets and the
major planets. This need occasion no confusion
with the general division of them into
major and minor planets, because, as has
been said, when simply “the planets” are
mentioned, these seven large planets are
always the ones that are meant, the others
being usually called asteroids, or planetoids.
The terrestrial planets are Mercury, Venus,
Earth, and Mars. As the name implies,
they are so called because they are in some
respects similar to the earth. The major
planets are Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus, and
Neptune. They are all larger than the terrestrial
planets, and, in addition, have some<span class="pagenum" title="42"><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42"></a></span>
other characteristics in common which the
planets of the other group do not have. The
two classes represent different stages of evolution.</p>

<p>The four planets forming the terrestrial
group are sometimes called the inner planets,
and the four major planets are then known
as the outer planets. The point of division
in mind then is the space between Mars and
Jupiter. This is so vast in comparison with
the spaces between the other planets from
the sun out to Mars that it becomes a
convenient dividing-line, particularly as the
groups divided by it are in some respects
essentially different from each other.</p>

<p>Of the four planets which have an especial
interest to us because of their being the ones
most easily seen, two are terrestrial, or inner,
planets, Mars and Venus, and two are major,
or outer, planets, Jupiter and Saturn. The
differences between the two classes are solely
matters of constitution and situation, and
have nothing to do with their appearance
to us. Venus, the brightest of them all, belongs
to one group; Jupiter, the second in
brilliancy, belongs to the other.</p>

<p>That there is at least one other planet
beyond the present boundary of our system<span class="pagenum" title="43"><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43"></a></span>
(which is the orbit of Neptune) seems to be
quite probable. Some astronomers think
there may be several others. There are certain
perturbations, or irregularities, in the
movements of Neptune which the influence
of Uranus does not account for, and they
seem to indicate that there is some disturbing
body even beyond the orbit of that
farthest known planet.</p>

<p>Several astronomers are working on the
problem of locating this undiscovered body.
At various times it has been announced that
such a planet would probably be found in a
certain position in the skies at a specified
date; but as yet no one has been able to
get a view of it. Recently the orbit of a far-off
hypothetical planet has been calculated,
and its place predicted for 1914. Perhaps
it may be found then. Of course it could
never be seen through any but the most
powerful telescopes. Its calculated distance
from the sun is one hundred and five times
that of the earth. This would be more than
nine billions of miles, or more than three
times farther than Neptune is from the sun.
It would require fourteen hours for light
to pass from the sun to a planet at that
distance, and the sun would appear to it<span class="pagenum" title="44"><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44"></a></span>
smaller than Saturn or an ordinary first-magnitude
star does to us.</p>

<p>A further reason for suspecting the existence
of such a planet is suggested by the
orbits of certain comets. These erratic
bodies, when they chance to come within
the bounds of the solar system, are sometimes
forced to remain because of the powerful
influence of one of the planets near which
their path has taken them. Jupiter holds
as many as thirty of them in this way,
Saturn and Uranus have two or three, and
Neptune has captured as many as six. But
there are still others that return to us in
regular periods, but which go sufficiently far
beyond Neptune to escape entirely if there
were not some still more distant watch-dog
to turn them back. So there seems good
reason to believe that Neptune is not really
the outermost of the planets.</p>

<p>There has also been much said about the
possibility of a planet nearer to the sun than
Mercury. When Mercury is at perihelion,
or nearest to the sun, there are certain irregularities
in his movements which might
be explained by the presence of another
planet between Mercury and the sun. In
1859 it was thought that such a planet had<span class="pagenum" title="45"><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45"></a></span>
been observed. Its time of revolution and its
distance from the sun were estimated, and it
was named Vulcan. In some of the books of
astronomy published about that time, and
even in some published as many as fifteen
years later, Vulcan is mentioned as a reality.
But now it is believed that the observation
was a mistake, and no such body is known
to exist.</p>

<p>In 1878 it was again thought that two bodies
nearer to the sun than Mercury had been discovered
during an eclipse. These observations
have never been explained or confirmed;
but it is thought that the objects seen were
probably stars which were mistaken for
planets by the observers. If a body so situated
does exist, it is so near the sun that
it probably can never be seen except during
an eclipse, and the time of observation is
then so short and mistakes are so easily
made that it is difficult to verify the observation.
The continued search for the cause
of the perturbations of Mercury may finally
lead to the discovery of something between
it and the sun. But if it is a single body,
this seems a much less promising task than
the search for a planet, or planets, on the
outer edge of the solar system.</p>

<h2>VI</h2>

<h3>THE MOVEMENTS OF THE PLANETS</h3>


<p>In considering the movements of the planets,
we have to regard their actual motion
in space and that motion as it appears
to us. They all have two principal
motions in space. They revolve about the
sun in their orbits, and they rotate on their
axes. The manner in which they accomplish
the rotation on their axes determines
the length of their days and nights, or
whether, indeed, they shall have any such
grateful alternations of light and darkness.
Those planets which, like the earth, turn on
their axes in less time than they make their
journey around the sun have one day and
one night every time they make a complete
rotation. Those that turn on their axes in
the same time that they revolve around the
sun, of which sort there seems to be at least
one, face always toward the sun, and have
no alternations of day and night. On one<span class="pagenum" title="47"><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47"></a></span>
side it is always day; on the other it is
always night. The number of days a planet
has during each revolution around the sun
depends upon how much time it requires to
make a revolution, and how fast it spins on its
axis. In one year here on the earth we have
three hundred and sixty-five days and nights.
Saturn, in its year, has more than twenty-three
thousand days and nights.</p>

<p>The manner in which the revolution of
the planets in their orbits takes place determines
the length and character of their year;
the nearer a planet is to the sun, the shorter
its orbit is, and the faster the rate of speed
at which the sun compels it to move, and
hence the shorter its year. The nearest of
the planets, Mercury, makes more than five
hundred revolutions around the sun, while
the farthest, Neptune, makes one. Three
times in a year&mdash;that is, a terrestrial year&mdash;the
nearest planet speeds around its orbit
and back to the starting-place with seventeen
days to spare. One hundred and sixty-five
terrestrial years are necessary for the farthest
planet to make one circuit of its orbit. The
first goes at the average rate of nearly thirty
miles a second over a path more than two
hundred million miles long. The second<span class="pagenum" title="48"><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48"></a></span>
travels a path more than seventeen billion
miles in length, at the average rate of three
and four-tenths miles a second. Between
these two extremes the other planets have
orbits and rates of speed varying with their
distances from the sun. The farther they are
from the sun, the larger the orbit and the
slower the speed.</p>

<p>To get something like a picture of the sun
and the planets as they actually lie and as
they move in space, one should have in mind
an immense flat, circular disc five and a half
billions of miles in diameter passing through
the sun, which is in the center of it. Around
the edge of the disc is the orbit through
which Neptune moves. At varying distances
inside of it are the orbits of the other
planets, each growing smaller and smaller
as one comes nearer and nearer to the sun,
until the orbit of Mercury, the planet nearest
to the sun, is reached.</p>

<p>Since it is not a hard metal disc that we
are considering, but only an imaginary one
in space, there may be a little latitude allowed
for the orbits to tip somewhat out of
the exact plane of the disc without materially
altering the figure in mind. And this they
do, very slightly&mdash;most of them to the ex<span class="pagenum" title="49"><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49"></a></span>tent
only of from one to two degrees, though
one of them falls outside of the common
plane about seven degrees. In these orbits
all the planets, as seen from the sun, are
going around from west to east. At the
same time they are turning on their axes in
the same direction, some standing almost
erect, as it were, in their orbits and whirling
like a dancing dervish as they skim along,
and others more or less inclined like a
traveling top.</p>

<p>The time a planet requires to make one
circuit of its orbit constitutes, as with the
earth, its year. But we who are on the earth
have, in our study of another planet, to regard
it as having in a sense two years. First,
there is the time it takes, starting from a
given point in its orbit, to circle around the
sun and return to that point. This is known
as its sidereal period, or year, and is so called
from <i>sidus</i>, meaning a star, because the only
way to mark any point in space is by a fixed
star, and, as viewed from the sun, one revolution
of a planet would be from a given
star back again to that star.</p>

<p>Then there is the time a planet takes,
starting when it is in a straight line with the
earth and the sun in space, to return to the<span class="pagenum" title="50"><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50"></a></span>
place where the three bodies will be again
in the same relative position. This is known
as its synodic period, or year. Synodic is
from our word synod, meaning a meeting
or assembly, and the synodic year is the time
between two successive and similar meetings
of these three bodies. The sidereal year concerns
the planet in its relation to the sun;
the synodic year, in its relation to the earth.
The synodic year is the only one that much
concerns us while regarding the planets as
a part of the spectacle of the sky. It is the
one that we know from observation, while
the sidereal year is mathematically computed.</p>

<p>The two periods, or years, are not of the
same length, because the sun with reference
to the planet is always stationary, and the
motion resulting in the sidereal year is that
of the planet only, while the synodic year
is the result of the movements of both the
earth and the planet, each, in its own orbit,
being always in motion.</p>

<p>An inferior planet, situated as it is nearer
to the sun than the earth is, and so having a
shorter orbit than the earth’s, will, when it
finishes its sidereal year and comes around
to the point from which it started, find the<span class="pagenum" title="51"><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51"></a></span>
earth advanced from that position and will,
therefore, have to travel farther on in order
to overtake it and come into the same relative
position from which they started, which
makes the time of its circuit with reference
to the earth obviously longer than with
reference to the sun.</p>

<p>With the superior planets the case is just
reversed. The earth is the inside planet,
or the one nearest the sun, and it must overtake
<i>them</i>. With one exception, they are all
so far away from the sun and move so slowly
that it takes us but little more than one of
our years to overtake them and bring them
into the same relative position with us that
they had when we started, while it requires
many of our years for any one of them to
make a single circuit of the sun. Hence
their circuit with reference to the earth is
shorter than with reference to the sun.</p>

<p>With Mars, the exception referred to, we
have a more hardly fought race. That
planet is not so far from us as are the other
superior planets. It makes its revolution
around the sun in a little less than two of
our years. We travel eighteen miles a second,
and it travels fifteen miles in the same
length of time. If we are in line with it at<span class="pagenum" title="52"><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52"></a></span>
the beginning of our journey, we glide off
swiftly, and easily leave it far behind. When,
however, we come back to the starting-point,
it has not loitered, and is many millions
of miles ahead of us, and it remains ahead
until more than seven weeks after we have
returned to the starting-point a second time.
Fifty days after we have begun to make our
third round we overtake it, and are again
in a direct line with the planet and the sun.
This makes its period with reference to the
earth ninety-three days longer than its own
year, and fifty days longer than two of ours.
This is the longest synodic period among
the planets.</p>

<p>The orbits in which the planets move all
have the form of an ellipse&mdash;that is, of a
circle more or less flattened. This flattening,
or the extent to which an orbit departs from
the form of a true circle, is called its eccentricity.
The sun is never at the exact center
of an orbit, but is always situated a little to
one side of the center&mdash;that is, it is at one
of the foci of the ellipse. Consequently, the
planet, as it travels in its orbit, is not always
at the same distance from the sun, the amount
of the variation in distance depending upon
the eccentricity of the orbit. The point in<span class="pagenum" title="53"><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53"></a></span>
the orbit where the planet is nearest to the
sun is its perihelion, and the point at which
it is farthest is its aphelion. It is necessary
to keep these elementary facts in mind in
order fully to understand the changes in the
motions and brightness of the planets.</p>

<p>The influence of one body over another
that is circling around it is to make it move
faster or more slowly according to its distance
from the central body. Since a planet
varies in its distance from the sun in the
different parts of its orbit, it is forced to
move fastest when it is in that part of the
orbit which is nearest to the sun, and slowest
when it is in the part farthest away. In
other words, the motion of a planet is more
rapid at perihelion than at aphelion. The
earth is in perihelion, or nearest to the sun,
in winter&mdash;that is, winter in the northern
latitudes&mdash;and in consequence it moves
faster in winter than in summer, and the
northern winters are, for this reason, a little
shorter than the summers.</p>

<p>These two simple movements of the
planets&mdash;that around the sun and that on
their axes&mdash;are their principal real movements,
and are such as they would show to
be if seen from the sun, which is the center<span class="pagenum" title="54"><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54"></a></span>
of them. There are also certain minor real
movements arising from various causes, one
being the influence that the planets exercise
on one another; but for the ordinary observer
these have no particular significance. Then,
the planets all share the one grand movement
which the sun itself is known to be
making through limitless space to a destination
of which we are in utter ignorance, over
even a path which we know nothing of save
that it leads toward the bright star Vega,
in the constellation of the Lyre. As the sun
moves on in that direction at the rate of
eleven miles a second he takes with him all
his family of planets and planetoids, with
their satellites, and whatever other bodies
have their abode in his domain. Thus they
travel as a body, each individual spinning
on its axis, from the sun itself down to the
smallest planetoid, the satellites circling
around the planets, and the planets in their
turn around the sun. And in all these
movements the earth takes part as one of
the planets. The sun itself is following a
comparatively straight line in space, and, so
far as we know, in allegiance to no other
body. It is, though, just possible that this
comparatively straight line may be the arc<span class="pagenum" title="55"><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55"></a></span>
of a circle so vast that we have not yet
had time to discover its curvature, and
that the sun itself may be pursuing its
own circuit around some still more powerful
body.</p>

<h2>VII</h2>

<h3>HOW THE INFERIOR PLANETS SEEM TO MOVE</h3>


<p>Of the real movements of the planets,
as described in the last chapter, we
get here on the earth only a very fragmentary
view. Without the aid of the telescope
none of them is visible to us except the
movements in their orbits, and these, to our
view, are somewhat different from the simple,
circling course apparent to an observer
on the sun. The difference is due to the
fact that the earth itself is always in movement
in just the same way that the other
planets are, and we, being never at any time
at the center of the orbits, do not see the
movements of the planets as they truly
take place, but only as they are outlined
against the sky. So the appearances and
disappearances and visible travels among
the stars by which we know the planets are
only as we see them. Some knowledge of
the real movements is necessary to a proper<span class="pagenum" title="57"><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57"></a></span>
understanding of the apparent movements;
but it is only with the latter that, for ordinary
observation, we need to be particularly
acquainted.</p>

<p>The rotation of the earth on its axis, as
we know, causes the familiar daily apparent
rising, passing, and setting of all the heavenly
bodies. In this apparent motion the
planets share as well as the sun, moon, and
stars. But it is their movement <i>among</i> the
fixed stars, and not <i>with</i> them, that distinguishes
them as planets, and this it is necessary
to know in order to keep track of them
and be able to recognize them in their varying
places and guises. For they sometimes
shine in their greatest glory in one season,
and sometimes in another, and at the recurrence
of the same season they are sometimes
in one part of the sky and sometimes
in another, so that their ways of coming and
going border almost on the mysterious, until
one learns the manner of this apparent
vagrancy. Happily, this knowledge is easily
attained, and then the matter is simple
enough.</p>

<p>The apparent motions of the inferior
planets, Mercury and Venus, always take
place near the sun. Venus never wanders<span class="pagenum" title="58"><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58"></a></span>
more than forty-eight degrees from it, and
Mercury never more than twenty-eight.
Most of the time they are much nearer than
this. Since we cannot see either of them
except when the sun is below the horizon,
the consequence of their being always thus
near to him is that they are in view for only
a short time after the sun has set or before
he has risen. If they are in the evening
sky, and hence east of the sun, they soon
follow him when he sinks below the western
horizon. If they are west of the sun, and,
consequently, are the first to rise in the
morning, it is not long before his brilliant
rays flood with light the eastern sky and blot
the planets from our view. Venus can be
seen sometimes for three hours at a time,
Mercury for never more than one. Within
this limited region of the sky they appear
to journey evening by evening away from
the sun, somewhat obliquely, but toward
the zenith, until they have reached the end
of their tether. Then they journey back and
pass to the other side of the sun. There
they climb their path toward the zenith,
moving westward and, as we see them, obliquely
upward. Morning by morning they
get farther from the sun until their west<span class="pagenum" title="59"><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59"></a></span>ward
limit of freedom is reached, when they
again draw in toward the sun, pass it, appear
in the evening sky, and pull off up the
sky toward the east again. Thus they swing
from east to west of the sun, and back again,
in unceasing repetition.</p>

<p>As they pass the sun going from east to
west&mdash;that is, from the evening to the morning
sky&mdash;the inferior planets go between us
and the sun; and when they swing back
from west to east, or from the morning to
the evening sky, they pass on the side of the
sun farthest away from us. When they are
in a direct line with the earth and the sun
they are said to be in conjunction. If at
this point they are between us and the
sun, it is inferior conjunction. If they are
on the other side of the sun, they are said
to be in superior conjunction. When the
planet, as seen in the evening, has traveled
toward the east as far from the sun as it
will go during that particular revolution, it
is said to be at its greatest eastern elongation.
Elongation means simply apparent
distance from the sun; hence, greatest eastern
elongation is the greatest distance possible
east of the sun from our point of view.
Greatest western elongation, which we see<span class="pagenum" title="60"><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60"></a></span>
in the morning before dawn, occurs when
the planet is at its greatest apparent distance
west of the sun.</p>

<p>While apparently drawing near and then
away from the sun, traveling obliquely up
and down the evening and the morning sky,
the planet has all the time been moving in
one direction around the sun; but we could
see the motion only as it appeared on the
background of the sky. The planet is in
reality just as far from the sun when it is
in conjunction as at elongation. The difference
is that we see it at a different angle,
or from a different point of view. But it has
not been at all times equally near to the
earth.</p>

<p>When an inferior planet is at greatest
eastern elongation, it is, of course, east of
the sun, and can be seen above the sun in
the evening after sunset, and is an evening
star. As it moves westward nearer and
nearer to the sun, it is above the horizon a
proportionately shorter time each evening,
and is more and more obscured by the sun’s
rays until it reaches inferior conjunction,
when it is exactly between us and the sun,
and hence at the point nearest to us. Here
it becomes invisible, largely because it has<span class="pagenum" title="61"><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61"></a></span>
its dark side toward us, but partly because
the dazzling light of the sun entirely obscures
it. Once in a while our relative positions are
such that we see it pass like a black dot
directly over the bright face of the sun.
This is called a transit. But a transit does
not occur at every inferior conjunction. It
would so occur if the planet’s orbit and
the earth’s were in exactly the same plane.
But the small tilt that they have is sufficient
to throw the planet, when it is passing the
sun, into such an angle that it does not pass
directly between the disc of the sun and us,
but a little above or below. Thus transits
are rather rare, though they occur periodically
in the case of both Venus and Mercury,
and will be spoken of elsewhere.</p>

<p>When the planet has passed inferior conjunction,
it is then west of the sun, and rises
in the morning before the sun is up, and is
a morning star. For a few days it can be
seen either not at all or with difficulty.
Then, as it works its way out of the rays of
the sun and on toward the west, it rises
earlier each morning until it reaches its
farthest point west.</p>

<p>As it starts back east again its distance
from the earth increases daily until it reaches<span class="pagenum" title="62"><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62"></a></span>
its greatest distance from us at superior
conjunction. It is then the whole diameter
of its orbit farther from us than when it was
at inferior conjunction, and it is again invisible.
The illuminated side of it is toward
us; but it is at its smallest, because it is
at its greatest distance from us, and even
when it is not directly behind the sun the
light of that luminary is too great for successful
competition. After it has passed superior
conjunction it is again in the evening
sky, apparently moving farther from the
sun each day. It is at the same time actually
coming nearer to us each day, and these
two facts cause a daily increase in its brightness.</p>

<p>But an inferior planet is not, like the superior
planets and the stars, brightest when
it is nearest to us. It is, in fact, darkest when
it is nearest&mdash;that is, when it is at inferior
conjunction&mdash;and we cannot see it at all.
This is because an inferior planet passes
through phases, like the moon, changing
gradually during its rounds from full to
crescent, and back again. Its full face is
toward us when it is on the opposite side of
the sun and farthest from us. The proportion
of the face that is illuminated grows<span class="pagenum" title="63"><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63"></a></span>
smaller as the planet approaches its eastern
elongation. But the planet grows brighter
because it is coming nearer to us and is
getting out of the dazzling rays of the sun.
One-half of its surface is illuminated when it
is at greatest elongation; but it is brightest
a few days later, when less than half of its
face is illuminated, because it is enough
nearer to compensate for the slight diminution
in the proportion of light on its disc.
It is brightest in the morning a short time
before its western elongation, for the same
reason.</p>

<p>This in a general way describes the motion
of an inferior planet, and this is all that we
need to know in order to understand its
ordinary visible movements. If we watch
it carefully, however, we may detect that
shortly before inferior conjunction it pauses
in its onward sweep and seems for a time
to be stationary, and then to retrace its way
among the stars until a short time after inferior
conjunction, when it again pauses
and appears stationary, and finally starts off
again in its original direction on its way toward
greatest western elongation. During
this capricious sort of progress the planet
usually describes more or less of a loop,<span class="pagenum" title="64"><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64"></a></span>
sometimes almost a flourish, in its path.
The appearance is wholly due to the planet’s
overtaking and passing us in our journey
around the sun. For a time it travels behind
us, then beside us, and then beyond
us; and, since we are both in motion, the
effect is much the same as when one train
passes another while they are both traveling
in the same direction. The orbits of the
earth and the planet are not exactly in the
same plane, and, both bodies being in motion,
we are not in a position to see the planet at
the same angle more than once as it seems
to pass back and forth, and so we get the
effect of its making a flourish or loop. But
this effect, while interesting, takes place only
when the planet is so near the sun that to
the ordinary observer it itself does not count
for much. We can see but little of the inferior
planets at that time, anyway, though
it is important for us to know where they
are, in order to keep track of them and to
be ready for them when they are to be seen.</p>

<h2>VIII</h2>

<h3>HOW THE SUPERIOR PLANETS SEEM TO MOVE</h3>


<p>The movements of the superior planets,
Mars, Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus, and
Neptune, as they appear to us, are different
from those of the inferior planets in some
important respects. Instead of swinging
back and forth east and west of the sun, and
never appearing very far away from it, as
the inferior planets do, the superior planets
make an entire circuit of the heavens, and
it is possible to see them at any distance
from the sun, and at any time during the
night. Sometimes they are, with relation
to the earth, in that part of the sky exactly
opposite to the sun, and hence in line with
it and the earth. At such times they can
be seen all night. They are then said to be
in opposition, and are in the best position
for our observation. The earth being, when
in this situation, in a direct line between
them and the sun, we have the sun at our<span class="pagenum" title="66"><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66"></a></span>
backs, as it were, shedding its full rays on
the disc of the planet under observation,
which is then at its nearest to us, and also
at its brightest. For, since the orbits of all
the superior planets are outside of ours, the
planets never get between us and the sun,
and, in consequence, never turn a dark side
toward us. Their entire discs are practically
always illuminated, and their changes in
brightness depend largely upon their changes
in distance, which, as we have seen, is not
the case with the inferior planets.</p>

<p>Mars, the nearest of them, is at times
somewhat gibbous (that is, shows a little
less than a full face, as the moon does when
just beginning to wane), and, in less degree,
Jupiter also. But in neither case is this
departure from fullness sufficient to have
any appreciable effect on the planet’s brightness,
and, moreover, it does not occur when
the planet is in the most favorable position
for us to see it. At opposition, therefore,
we always have the full face of the planet
presented to us; and being, as we then are,
on the same side of the sun with it, we are
ninety-three millions of miles (our distance
from the sun) nearer to it than the sun is.</p>

<p>Being, when in opposition, exactly oppo<span class="pagenum" title="67"><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67"></a></span>site
the sun, the planet rises just as the sun
sets. After opposition it rises a little earlier
each evening, and is higher up in the sky
at each succeeding sunset. When we find it
just half-way between the eastern and the
western horizon at sunset, it is at quadrature.
After quadrature it appears nearer
and nearer the western horizon each evening
at sunset, until it finally is too near the sun
to be visible. It is then traveling in that
part of its orbit which is beyond the sun
from us. From opposition to this situation
it has been an evening star.</p>

<p>When a superior planet is in line with the
sun and the earth, and is on the far side of
the sun from us, it is said to be in conjunction,
and we are then one hundred and
eighty-six millions of miles, or twice our
distance from the sun, farther from it than
we are when it is in opposition. But besides
being placed at so much greater distance
from it, we have in this situation the
bright sun excluding the planet from our
view. It will be readily seen, therefore, why
the superior planets are in so much better
position for us to see them in opposition
than at conjunction.</p>

<p>From conjunction to opposition the planet<span class="pagenum" title="68"><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68"></a></span>
is west of the sun, and will be below the
horizon at sunset, and will rise some time
during the night. At first it will appear
just before sunrise as a morning star, but
will gradually rise earlier each night until,
when it reaches opposition again, it will
rise just as the sun sets. Half-way between
conjunction and opposition it is again at
quadrature.</p>

<p>From opposition to conjunction the planet
will be east of the sun and above the horizon
at sunset. When a planet is in conjunction
with the sun, it passes the meridian, or the
point half-way between rising and setting,
about noon, and is above the horizon with
the sun during the day. When it is in opposition
it passes the meridian about midnight,
and is above the horizon during the
night. When it is at quadrature and moving
toward conjunction, it passes the meridian
about six o’clock in the evening, and
may be seen in the western half of the sky
during the early evening, and will set before
midnight. When it is at quadrature and
moving toward opposition, it will rise some
time between midnight and sunset, and will
be in view in the east during a part of the
first half of the night. The nearer it is to<span class="pagenum" title="69"><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69"></a></span>
opposition, the earlier in the evening it rises
and the longer it may be seen.</p>

<p>The main movement of the superior planets
among the stars is from west to east, and
this is known as their direct motion. But
not far from opposition they seem to hesitate,
then move more slowly, then finally
stop, remain stationary for a time, turn
back on their tracks, and start off in the
opposite direction. This is their retrograde
motion. They do not continue in it as
long as in the direct motion; but after a
comparatively short time they again hesitate,
go more slowly, stop, remain stationary,
then turn back and swing off in the
original direction, and continue to move in
this direction until they are again approaching
opposition. It is exactly in the middle of
this sweep toward the west that the planet
is in opposition. Close observation will
show that the superior planets also make
something of the same sort of a loop in their
path among the stars that the inferior planets
make, and for the same reason. The only
difference is that when a superior planet is
retrograding we are passing it, and when an
inferior planet retrogrades it is passing us.</p>

<p>In giving this rather rough outline of the<span class="pagenum" title="70"><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70"></a></span>
way the planets in general move among the
stars, reaching in their wanderings these
various positions with relation to the sun
and the earth, the intention is only to fix
some definite situations from which to consider
the movements of the individual
planets. When we come to know each planet
as an individual, and to follow it as it comes
and goes in the heavens, and to watch its
ever-wonderful changes in brilliancy, these
situations will have a much more definite
meaning to us and a relatively greater interest
and importance. The planets as they
appear to us all move along pretty much the
same path; but each has its own way of
gracing this path, and each its particular
manner of changing in aspect.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" title="71"><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71"></a></span></p>




<h2>IX</h2>

<h3>THE PATH OF THE PLANETS</h3>


<p>Though the planets are called wanderers,
they are not by any means the
vagrants that the name might imply. They
have a fixed course among the stars from
which they never deviate, and the ways of
all of them, and also of the sun and the
moon, are confined to a comparatively narrow
strip in the sky.</p>

<p>That strip is called the zodiac. It is
only sixteen degrees wide, and extends like a
narrow band all the way around the heavens.
It lies so that it is always easy to observe;
and, being so limited, very little observation
is necessary to become familiar with every
part of it. Within its limits all the movements
of the sun, the moon, and the planets
take place. Through the center of it is the
ecliptic, the great circle that marks the
annual apparent path of the sun through<span class="pagenum" title="72"><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72"></a></span>
the heavens. It is the standard circle from
which we measure the paths of the moon
and the planets. Whatever degree their
courses vary from the ecliptic is what we
call the inclination of their orbits. If the plane
of the orbit of a planet is tilted away from the
ecliptic, the planet will travel half the time
on one side of it, and half the time on the
other.</p>

<p>The orbits are, in fact, very little inclined
to the ecliptic, and all but one of the planets
may always be found within three degrees
of it, most of them nearer than this. The
one exception is Mercury, which is sometimes
as much as seven degrees from this central
line of the zodiac, but ordinarily it is not so
far as this. Uranus is so nearly on the
ecliptic that an ordinary observer would not
notice the deviation, and particularly as
Uranus can rarely be detected with the
naked eye, and can never be thus followed.
Of the four planets which are the ones we
ordinarily see, Mars and Jupiter are never
as much as two degrees from the ecliptic,
Saturn never more than two and a half
degrees, and Venus never more than about
three degrees. They are all usually nearer
than these outside limits. The greatest dis<span class="pagenum" title="73"><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73"></a></span>tance
of the moon from the ecliptic is about
one and a half degrees.</p>

<p>Hence, with the exception of Mercury, all
the planets and the sun and the moon travel
in a path six degrees wide, which is only one
degree wider than the distance between the
pointers as we see them in the Great Dipper.
The fact that the zodiac is sixteen degrees
wide, or eight degrees on each side of the
ecliptic, is due only to a very generous allowance
for the vagaries of Mercury, which
he really does not quite need. For Mercury
is always as much as twice the breadth of the
moon, or one degree, inside of the zodiac, and
usually more than that.</p>

<p>Because the earth is tilted on its axis
twenty-three and a half degrees from the
perpendicular, the ecliptic runs through the
heavens in an oblique circle, crossing the
line of the equator at two points called the
vernal and autumnal equinoxes. The equator
in the heavens is the great circle extending
around the celestial sphere half-way
between the north and south poles. It is
always practically ninety degrees from the
north star, and the points at which the
ecliptic intersects it are called the equinoxes.
These are the only two points on the ecliptic<span class="pagenum" title="74"><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74"></a></span>
that are just ninety degrees from the pole.
The word equinox is derived from <i>equus</i>
(equal) and <i>nox</i> (night), and when the sun
is at the equinoxes the days and nights are
of equal length.</p>

<p>From the vernal to the autumnal equinox
the line of the ecliptic is north of the equator,
and hence high in the sky, reaching its highest
point midway between the equinoxes.
It then crosses the equator again and runs
obliquely south to the lowest point in its
path, and then curves northerly back to the
vernal equinox. The vernal equinox is the
point at which the sun arrives when spring
begins. This results in the sun’s being
north of the equator from spring until
autumn, and south of it from autumn to
spring.</p>

<p>As the part of the zodiac that we can see
best at night is that opposite where the sun
is, so in summer, when the sun is high, we
see best the part of the zodiac which is low
in the southern skies in the evening; and in
the winter, when the sun is in the southern
half of his journey, the part of the zodiac
best seen by us is high in the heavens. No
part of it, however, is ever as high as the
zenith, or directly overhead, and no planet<span class="pagenum" title="75"><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75"></a></span>
is ever seen as far north as the zenith in
any place whose latitude is more than twenty-three
and one-half degrees from the equator.</p>

<p>To know the paths of the planets it is
necessary to know only twelve constellations
out of the seventy or more in the entire
heavens; but it is difficult to imagine any
one’s learning these twelve without becoming
interested in and more or less acquainted
with many of the splendid stars and constellations
that lie on each side of them.
The larger one’s acquaintance is with the
appearance of the skies as a whole, the
easier, naturally, it will be to distinguish
the planets from the stars, and to follow
their courses. But the planets themselves
may be intimately known quite apart from
any but the twelve constellations forming
the zodiac. Happily, among them we shall
find some of the most beautiful constellations
in the heavens, and some of the
most splendidly brilliant first-magnitude
stars.<a id="FNanchor_1" href="#Footnote_1" class="fnanchor">1</a></p>

<p>The twelve constellations of the zodiac
are as follows:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" title="76"><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76"></a></span></p>

<p class="ml2em">
Pisces, the Fishes.<br />
Aries, the Ram.<br />
Taurus, the Bull.<br />
Gemini, the Twins.<br />
Cancer, the Crab.<br />
Leo, the Lion.<br />
Virgo, the Virgin.<br />
Libra, the Scales or Balance.<br />
Scorpio, the Scorpion.<br />
Sagittarius, the Archer.<br />
Capricornus, the Goat.<br />
Aquarius, the Water-Carrier.<br />
</p>

<p>We shall begin at the point of the vernal
equinox to trace the line of the ecliptic
through these constellations, and that line
will mark for us the path of the sun, the moon,
and all the planets. It is convenient to begin
at this point, because it is where the sun
crosses the equator in the spring, and hence
it is at the beginning of that part of the
ecliptic which lies north of the equator.</p>

<p>The point of the vernal equinox is now
situated in the constellation Pisces. It is
not marked by any bright star, but is not
very difficult to find. It marks the point
on the eastern horizon where the sun rises
about March 21st, and about the 21st of
September it is on the eastern horizon exactly
opposite that point in the western sky
where the sun sets. It is always ninety<span class="pagenum" title="77"><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77"></a></span>
degrees from the pole, and if one chances
to know the constellation Cassiopeia, which
is shaped like a chair and is on the opposite
side of the pole from the Big Dipper, one
can locate the vernal equinox by drawing a
line from the pole-star through the star
which marks the lower part of the front of
the chair, and extending it until it is ninety
degrees long. The ninety degrees can be estimated
by using the distance between the pointers
in the Dipper (which is five degrees) as a
measure. The star mentioned in Cassiopeia is
about thirty-two degrees from the north star.</p>

<div><p class="tac">MAP SHOWING THE CONSTELLATIONS OF THE ZODIAC AND
THE LINE OF THE ECLIPTIC RUNNING THROUGH THEM</p>

<p class="tac">The paths of all the planets, save one, lie always within three
degrees of the ecliptic.</p></div>
</div>

<p>Having once learned the constellations of
the zodiac and, approximately, the line of
the ecliptic, it is not necessary for the ordinary
observer to keep in mind the exact
location of the vernal equinox. It is, however,
an important point for the student of
mathematical astronomy.</p>

<p>Beginning at this point, the ecliptic runs
through Pisces in a northeasterly direction
for about thirty degrees to Aries, the second
constellation of the zodiac.</p>


<h3>ARIES</h3>

<p>Aries is best seen in the autumn when the
sun is in the opposite side of the heavens. It<span class="pagenum" title="78"><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78"></a></span>
is marked by a small acute-angled triangle,
with the apex toward the north and the
brightest star of the three at the apex. This
star is called Hamal, and, while not a first-magnitude
star, is a rather bright one of the
second magnitude; and the triangle itself is
very distinctly marked. It is the only
group of stars by which to distinguish Aries,
and it is sometimes confused with the little
constellation called Triangulum, which lies
just west of it, or above it, as it rises. With
this in mind, Triangulum may be made to
serve as an identifying mark. They both
rise just a trifle north of the exact east early
in the evenings of late September and October.
Triangulum rises first, with its apex
toward the south. In less than an hour the
triangle of Aries arrives with its apex pointed
north. The ecliptic runs about five degrees
below this triangle, and its path across Aries
is about twenty-eight degrees long. When
one sees any very bright star in Aries, one
may be sure it is a planet. The sun is in
Aries from April 16th to May 13th.</p>

<p>During the summer this constellation is
not visible in the early evening; but it may
be seen every evening from September to
April, drawing all the time nearer to the sun,<span class="pagenum" title="79"><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79"></a></span>
and setting earlier each evening until the
sun blots it out. From this constellation
the ecliptic runs into Taurus, the third
zodiacal constellation.</p>


<h3>TAURUS</h3>

<p>This constellation may be identified by
the brilliant first-magnitude star Aldebaran,<a id="FNanchor_2" href="#Footnote_2" class="fnanchor">2</a>
and the misty Little Dipper of the
Pleiades. It is a very beautiful and large
constellation. About an hour and a half
after the triangle of Aries has risen, the soft-twinkling
cluster of tiny stars which form
the Pleiades comes above the eastern horizon,
and about an hour later a V-shaped
cluster of brighter stars, with a very bright-red
one at the end of the lower half of the
V, appears. This last cluster is the Hyades,
and the bright star is Aldebaran.</p>

<p>By these two clusters we may know the
constellation. The ecliptic passes across
Taurus about four degrees east of the
Pleiades, and about seven degrees west of
Aldebaran. The planets in passing through
this region often come very close to the<span class="pagenum" title="80"><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80"></a></span>
Pleiades, and parts of the group are sometimes
occulted by the moon. Taurus is
conspicuous in the eastern evening sky from
September until nearly January. From that
time on until May it may be seen in the
evening, high up in the sky, a little farther
west each evening, until it disappears in
May. Among the four planets that we most
see Mars is the only one that resembles
Aldebaran in color. They are both reddish,
but Mars is always west of Aldebaran near
the line of the ecliptic, and also it does not
have the same twinkling face that Aldebaran
shows; hence the star and the planet
need never be confused. Mercury, it is
true, is reddish and twinkles, but so seldom
needs to be taken into account that it will
not be troublesome. The other planets when
in Taurus will proclaim themselves by their
color and size. There is no very bright star
in Taurus except Aldebaran, which has been
described. Any bright star north of it in
the constellation is sure to be a planet.</p>

<p>Through Taurus the line of the ecliptic
runs in a northeasterly direction, and about
fifteen degrees east from Aldebaran it passes
about half-way between two fairly bright
stars which mark the tips of the horns of<span class="pagenum" title="81"><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81"></a></span>
Taurus, and from there on into the fourth
constellation.</p>


<h3>GEMINI</h3>

<p>Gemini lies northeast of Taurus, and is
outlined by a box-shaped figure something
more than twenty degrees long and about
five degrees wide. The two stars marking
the end of it farthest from Taurus are the
famous twins, Castor and Pollux.<a id="FNanchor_3" href="#Footnote_3" class="fnanchor">3</a> Pollux
is a first-magnitude star, and Castor is very
little less bright. They are both very charming
stars, and too conspicuous to escape easy
identification. Castor is greenish in tint,
and rises between an hour and a half and
two hours later than Aldebaran. About
fifteen minutes after he appears, Pollux,
with a yellow-tinted face, comes up over
the eastern horizon. They rise about thirty
degrees north of the exact east. The ecliptic
has reached its highest point north just
after passing through the horns of Taurus.
It then runs through Gemini in a southeasterly
direction, curving diagonally across
the main figure and passing five or six degrees
below Pollux. Gemini can be seen<span class="pagenum" title="82"><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82"></a></span>
from October to early June. It is particularly
charming in May in the northwest
just after sundown, and when any of the
planets are going along this part of their
path at that season, they are sure to win
one’s interest and admiration.</p>


<h3>CANCER</h3>

<p>After leaving Gemini the ecliptic passes
through the small constellation Cancer. Its
way runs southeasterly for about twenty
degrees, passing just south of a charming
little cluster of stars which can be dimly
seen with the unaided eye, but comes out
brilliantly with an opera-glass. It is called
Præsepe, or the Bee-hive, and is the only
object to attract attention in Cancer. Fortunately,
it is so situated as to mark the
line of the ecliptic through the constellation.
The Bee-hive rests almost exactly on the
ecliptic.</p>


<h3>LEO</h3>

<p>Leaving Cancer, the sun enters Leo, a
large, well-marked constellation known to
many persons by the conspicuous figure in
it of a sickle. At the end of the handle of<span class="pagenum" title="83"><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83"></a></span>
the Sickle is Regulus, one of the bright first-magnitude
stars. A little more than fifteen
degrees east of the Sickle the rest of the constellation
is marked by a large triangle
formed by three rather bright stars. Both
of these figures are well marked and easily
seen, making Leo one of the easiest of the
constellations to find. The sun crosses it in
a southeasterly direction which leads straight
across Regulus. The star is often occulted
by the moon, and by the sun also, though
that we cannot see on account of the blinding
light of the sun.</p>

<p>Leo is visible nearly eight months in the
year. It is in the eastern sky early in the
evening in the winter, and shines all night
from late in December until April. In May
and June it is traveling westerly, but high
up in the sky. In July it is in the western
sky in the evening. The sun passes through
it from August 7th to September 14th.
Regulus is a white star, and twinkles violently,
so that it is easily distinguished from any
planet that is passing near it. In the other
part of the constellation the path of the
planets runs about ten degrees below the
triangle.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" title="84"><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84"></a></span></p>


<h3>VIRGO</h3>

<p>When the sun has passed Leo it enters the
largest of all the constellations, Virgo, and
passes through it in forty-five days, from
September 14th to October 29th. The constellation
is far from rich in bright stars;
but one may find the ecliptic, or path of the
sun, by following a curved southeasterly line
from Regulus about sixty-five degrees until
it reaches Spica,<a id="FNanchor_4" href="#Footnote_4" class="fnanchor">4</a> a very bright first-magnitude
star in this comparatively starless
region. If there is any doubt about Spica,
it may be found by following the curve of the
handle of the Big Dipper about thirty degrees,
which brings one to the splendid
Arcturus, and then about thirty degrees
farther on, which points one to Spica.</p>

<p>Eight or nine days after entering Virgo
the sun crosses the equator at the autumnal
equinox, and the rest of the ecliptic lies
farther south. Spica is about ten degrees
south of the equator.</p>

<p>Spica is in the east during the early evenings
in April and May; throughout June
and July it may be seen in the south during<span class="pagenum" title="85"><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85"></a></span>
the evening. In October it sets at about
the same time as the sun.</p>

<p>The autumnal equinox, or the point where
the ecliptic crosses to the south of the
equator, is in Virgo, and lies about fifteen
degrees northeast of Spica.</p>


<h3>LIBRA</h3>

<p>Libra is the next zodiacal constellation,
and it is a small one. The sun passes through
it in about twenty-three days. It may be
known by four fairly bright stars which form
a more or less imperfect square. The ecliptic
passes along the southern edge of this figure.</p>

<p>During the summer and early autumn,
Libra is best seen. It is then passing across
the southern sky, drawing nearer the west
each evening. A planet passing across this
constellation would always be easy to identify,
since it would always be so much brighter
than any star in this region. The sun enters
Libra about October 29th, and it is not visible
in the evening during the rest of the
year.</p>


<h3>SCORPIO</h3>

<p>It is a joy to know Scorpio, quite aside
from its connection with the path of the<span class="pagenum" title="86"><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86"></a></span>
planets. It is a brilliant constellation, best
seen during the summer and autumn, as it
passes across the southern sky. It is the
most southerly of any of the constellations of
the zodiac; but the ecliptic passes through
only a very small portion of the northern
part of it, so the sun does not reach the
most southerly point in its path while it is
in this constellation.</p>

<p>Scorpio may be best identified by its brilliant
deep-red star Antares,<a id="FNanchor_5" href="#Footnote_5" class="fnanchor">5</a> which is supposed
to lie in the heart of the Scorpion.
The whole figure makes a splendid serpent-like
sweep toward the southern horizon,
and is one of the most conspicuous objects
just west of the Milky Way in the
south in summer.</p>

<p>The line of the ecliptic runs about three
degrees north of Antares; hence the planets
in their course sometimes pass very near it.
Jupiter has been in that region all this year
(1912), and will not be far from there the
early part of 1913. Mercury and Mars
both have something the color of Antares;
but this is not likely to result in any confusion.
The star is always there, and in the<span class="pagenum" title="87"><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87"></a></span>
same relative situation with reference to the
other stars. When Mars is there, it will
always be above the star. Mercury can seldom
be seen when he is in Scorpio. If he is
in greatest elongation while there, he will still
be near the sun, and the sun, as seen from the
middle latitudes, is so far south and so near
the horizon when in that part of the ecliptic
that the situation will not be favorable for
seeing the planet. Farther south, and particularly
in high altitudes, Mercury could
be well seen in Scorpio, but if the position
of Antares is kept in mind, Mercury will
easily be recognized as a stranger in the
constellation.</p>

<p>The sun enters Scorpio about November
21st, and the constellation then ceases to
be visible in the evening sky until the following
May. It is in its greatest glory
during the summer and early autumn.</p>


<h3>SAGITTARIUS</h3>

<p>When the sun leaves Scorpio it crosses
the Milky Way into Sagittarius, and there
reaches the lowest point in its path, twenty-three
and one-half degrees south of the
equator. This constellation is best dis<span class="pagenum" title="88"><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88"></a></span>tinguished
by the little “milk dipper,” which
is easily seen turned upside down just at the
eastern edge of the Milky Way. The line
of the ecliptic runs a little north of it. The
constellation may be best seen during about
the same months that Scorpio is visible.
The sun enters it, and it passes out of view
about the middle of December.</p>


<h3>CAPRICORNUS AND AQUARIUS</h3>

<p>From Sagittarius the ecliptic runs in a
northeasterly direction through a region in
which there are no very bright stars, nor
any very distinct outlines of figures. The
two constellations through which it passes
are Capricornus and Aquarius. It then runs
a few degrees into Pisces, and there reaches
the vernal equinox, where we began to trace
its course.</p>

<p>Although one cannot trace the line of the
ecliptic with the same definiteness in this
region as in one where there are bright stars
to mark the way, yet when a planet is in
this part of its path it is perhaps more conspicuous
and more easily recognized than
when it appears in any other part of the sky,
because of the very absence of other bright<span class="pagenum" title="89"><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89"></a></span>
bodies. These constellations comprise all that
region running from the Milky Way east
to the vernal equinox. It is a part of the
heavens easily seen during the pleasant
evenings of summer and autumn, and if a
planet is crossing it during those seasons it
is particularly well placed for observation.</p>

<p>The two brightest stars in Capricornus
are of the third magnitude, and lie about
twenty degrees northeast of the “milk dipper.”
The ecliptic runs just under them.
Through Aquarius it runs six or seven degrees
above a waving line of faint stars,
which are supposed to represent the water
that Aquarius is pouring from his urn.</p>

<p>If one will take the trouble to trace the
line of the ecliptic through the sky, and remember
that it lies exactly in the center of
the zodiac, and that the planets are, therefore,
within a very few degrees of it, one will
have no trouble in keeping track of them.
The mere knowing of these constellations is
in most cases sufficient, since the planets will
disclose their identity in other ways than by
position merely.</p>

<p>The <i>signs</i> of the zodiac are somewhat different
from the constellations. They are
simply twelve equal divisions of thirty de<span class="pagenum" title="90"><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90"></a></span>grees
each, making in all three hundred and
sixty degrees, which is the whole number of
degrees in any circle. They are so divided
for convenience in scientific observation and
reckoning. About two thousand years ago
the signs and the constellations in the main
coincided, and they still bear the same names.
The point of the vernal equinox was then at
the beginning of the sign and the constellation
Aries. But, owing to certain motions
of the earth, this point shifts backward, or
toward the west, about one degree every
seventy-two years. In two thousand years
it has shifted about twenty-eight degrees,
until now the sign Aries, with the vernal
equinox at its western boundary, lies almost
wholly in the constellation Pisces, the sign
Taurus corresponds approximately to the
constellation Aries, and so on around the
circle. It is important to know this in following
the planets, because all almanacs and
scientific publications deal mainly with the
<i>signs</i> of the zodiac, and not with the <i>constellations</i>.
When a planet’s place is said to be
in Aries, Taurus, or Gemini, one will find it in
Pisces, Aries, or Taurus, respectively. And
so it is with all the other signs; they are
each one constellation behind the one bear<span class="pagenum" title="91"><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91"></a></span>ing
the same name. And this is why, beginning
with the vernal equinox, Pisces is
the first constellation in the zodiac, while
Aries is the first sign.</p>

<p>The following is a list of the signs of the
zodiac, with the corresponding constellations.
The symbols given in parenthesis
are the ones used for these signs in all
almanacs:</p>

<h2>X</h2>

<h3>MERCURY</h3>


<p>While Mercury is one of the five planets
that can be seen with the naked eye,
it must be confessed that he does not play
any important part in the great spectacle
of nature as we see it in the skies. But in
a certain way this only adds to our interest
in him. The very rarity of his appearances
and the difficulty of finding him give a zest
to the search, and a sense of achievement,
when it is successful, that one does not have
with regard to the other planets. It is
something akin to the feeling one has when,
after a long tramp to some secluded recess
in the woods in search of the shy pink lady’s
slipper, a splendid specimen of that lovely
flower suddenly comes into view hanging
gaily on its stalk, ready for the use of whatever
fairy foot may tread its shady groves.</p>

<p>Then, too, the spring o’ the year is the most
likely time to see Mercury in the evening sky.
He comes into his best position for this view<span class="pagenum" title="94"><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94"></a></span>
of him just when the evenings are growing
longer and milder and one begins to hunger
for outdoor things, so that the quest of
him at that time has the gladness that goes
with our first excursions into the open after
a winter’s housing, whether it be in search of
flowers, or birds, or stars, or simply the general
loveliness of everything that belongs to
the beginning of the outdoor season.</p>

<p>The reason Mercury is so elusive is that
he is always very near the sun, and in consequence
his light is dimmed by the brighter
light shed by that luminary until it is well
below the horizon; and after the sun has
set, the planet is so involved in the usual
haziness of the atmosphere near the horizon
that the conditions must be very favorable
in order to see him. Though there are
recorded observations of Mercury as far
back as nearly three hundred years before
Christ, yet some of the older of the modern
astronomers, before the days of the perfected
telescope, are said not to have seen him at
all; and the most important observations of
the planet nowadays are made in broad daylight,
when it is higher up in the skies and
free from the mists of the horizon. This
can be done by means of a powerful tele<span class="pagenum" title="95"><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95"></a></span>scope,
because it is possible in this way to
shut off the light of surrounding bodies;
but, of course, the conditions are not as
favorable as if midnight observations could
be made. Still, if one knows just when and
where to look, Mercury can be seen with
the naked eye at least once or twice a year,
and sometimes oftener than this, especially
if one chances to live in one of the Western
States, where the air is very clear and the
situation in latitude and altitude more favorable
than, say, in New England, or in the
middle Atlantic States. In our Northern
States, and in the whole of England, this
planet is more difficult to see, because of
the longer twilight in northern latitudes,
and also because the line of the ecliptic, over
which it passes, seems there lower down in
the skies, while in the far South, say in
Cuba or Porto Rico, the twilight is shorter,
the ecliptic runs high in the sky, and the
situation is favorable for a good view even
though the atmosphere is no clearer than
it is farther north.</p>


<h3>WHEN AND WHERE TO FIND MERCURY</h3>

<p>Mercury is never more than twenty-eight
degrees from the sun, and is bright<span class="pagenum" title="96"><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96"></a></span>est
when the distance between them is
somewhere near twenty-two degrees, or
about four times the distance between the
pointers in the Big Dipper. The direction
in which to search for him must always be
along the line of the ecliptic obliquely above
the sun. Since his orbit is inclined seven
degrees to the ecliptic, he will be some place
within seven degrees of this line, on one side
or the other. Within this narrow strip in
the sky, fourteen degrees wide and twenty-eight
degrees long, Mercury will be found
whenever he is visible at all. And this strip
may be further shortened by at least twelve
degrees; for when the planet is nearer than
that to the sun it is futile to attempt to see
him with the naked eye, save in very exceptional
conditions. The five degrees between
the pointers will serve as an aid in
measuring these distances.</p>

<p>We can never see Mercury with the naked
eye except when he is near one elongation or
the other; and even then he is visible only
about an hour after the sun is down in the
evening or about an hour before it rises in
the morning. Three times each year he
appears in the evening for more or less than
a week, according to the situation of the<span class="pagenum" title="97"><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97"></a></span>
observer, and three times a year he is visible
in the morning for about the same length of
time. But, owing to his position with relation
to us, the evening exhibit that comes in
the spring is the most favorable one for a
good view of him, and the morning appearance
that is most favorable is the one that
comes in the autumn.</p>

<p>The mean synodic period of Mercury is
about one hundred and sixteen days, or a
little less than four months. That is, he
returns to greatest eastern elongation and
can be seen in the evening sky about every
one hundred and sixteen days, and the same
length of time elapses between his appearances
in the morning sky at greatest western
elongation. But this mean synodic period
is made up of synodic periods varying in different
revolutions from one hundred and five
to one hundred and thirty-four days. So,
though one may mark the dates at which the
various positions of the planet occurred during
any one revolution, one cannot so easily
determine the exact time at which he will
be found in the same positions at the next
revolution; that is, whether the revolution
will take place in less or more than one hundred
and sixteen days. The earth and the<span class="pagenum" title="98"><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98"></a></span>
planet are each traveling at varying rates
of speed, according as they are near the sun
or farther from it, and obviously it is a situation
that requires careful mathematical work
to compute. The almanac must be referred
to for the exact date.</p>

<p>But, lacking an almanac, one will generally
find that Mercury will return to the same
position relative to the earth and the sun
within a few days of his mean synodic period.
Three periods, however much they may vary
individually, are almost always equal to
three hundred and forty-eight days, or three
times the mean period. This is seventeen
days less than a year. Hence, if one is
lucky enough to have seen Mercury at eastern
elongation one spring, and will look the
next year about seventeen days earlier, the
planet will be found a little to the east
(about fifteen degrees) of where he was when
first seen the year before. He is there in
the same position with relation to us and
the sun that he had the preceding spring,
but in a slightly different relation to us and
the stars, because the sun lacks seventeen
days of having completed its apparent yearly
journey around the zodiac. It must still
go through about one half of a constellation.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" title="99"><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99"></a></span></p>

<p>When Mercury shows himself at eastern
elongation, he may be seen in the west as
an evening star for somewhere near a week,
each evening drawing nearer to the sun.
When he disappears from view he passes between
us and the sun, and about four weeks
later appears in the morning sky before the
sun rises. Under favorable conditions he is
again visible for a week or more; and then,
again approaching the sun, he can be seen
no more for about ten weeks, during which
time he passes through superior conjunction
on the other side of the sun from us and
comes back to eastern elongation.</p>

<p>Thus we can get, under very favorable
conditions, six short views of Mercury during
the year&mdash;three in the evening and three
in the morning. So many views, however,
are rarely secured by any but the professional
observer. The circumstances may well be
considered felicitous if one succeeds in getting
a glimpse of him once or twice a year&mdash;at
his favorable situation in the evening in
the spring and the morning in the autumn.
The sight of him, though, is truly worth a
little inconvenience&mdash;even to the extent of
facing a cold evening wind in the very early
spring or getting out of a comfortable bed<span class="pagenum" title="100"><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100"></a></span>
before dawn during the first cool mornings
of autumn.</p>

<p>It is hardly possible to say exactly where
one can find Mercury at all times during
a long succession of revolutions. Moreover,
it is not necessary. These computations
are made anew each year by experts in the
employ of the government, and the result
is published in the <i>Nautical Almanac</i>. From
there it finds its way into all almanacs, so
it is easy of access to any one.</p>

<p>In the almanacs Mercury is represented
by the sign (☿). It is a conventionalized
form of the caduceus, or wand, carried by
the god Mercury as a symbol of his power.</p>

<p>The next seven eastern and western elongations
of Mercury occurring after the publication
of this book are as follows:</p>

<h3>DISTANCE AND BRIGHTNESS</h3>

<p>Of all the planets Mercury is nearest the
sun. His average distance is thirty-six
million miles. He is nearly eighty times
nearer than Neptune, the outermost planet,
and more than two and one-half times nearer
than we are. But his orbit departs so far
from being a circle that his distance from
the sun varies as much as fifteen million
miles. When he is nearest the sun, or in
perihelion, he is only twenty-eight million
miles from it; when he is farthest, or in
aphelion, his distance is forty-three million
miles. There is even greater variation in his
distance from us. The difference between
his least possible and his greatest possible
distance from us is as much as eighty-nine
millions of miles. For the earth has an
elliptical orbit as well as Mercury, and when
we are at perihelion, which occurs in the
winter, we are three millions of miles nearer
to the sun than we are in mid-summer. If
Mercury chances to be then at his greatest
distance from the sun, and also at inferior
conjunction, or between us and the sun, he
is only forty-seven millions of miles from us.
If, when we are farthest from the sun, he<span class="pagenum" title="102"><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102"></a></span>
also is at his greatest distance from it, and
is in superior conjunction, or on the other
side of the sun from us, he is one hundred
and thirty-six millions of miles from us.</p>

<p>These changes in distance from the earth
have much to do with Mercury’s changes
in apparent brightness to us. At his brightest,
when he appears at greatest elongation
and we can see him without a telescope, he
is brighter than Arcturus, the brilliant first-magnitude
star in Boötes, that swings over
us nightly from early spring to late autumn.
When seen with the naked eye, he is also
red in color, somewhat like Arcturus; but
through a telescope he is dull silver, like the
moon, or even more ashy in his paleness.
As he goes farther and farther from us he
becomes dimmer and dimmer and can be
followed only with a telescope until, even
with this aid to vision, he is lost in the rays
of the sun at superior conjunction. His apparent
diameter as mathematically measured
varies from five seconds, when he is
farthest away, to thirteen seconds, when he
is nearest.</p>

<p>When he is at his nearest possible distance
from us, light travels from Mercury to us
in a little more than four minutes. At his<span class="pagenum" title="103"><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103"></a></span>
greatest possible distance we could not receive
the waves of light that he sends out
in less than twelve minutes. As a matter
of fact, we do not receive them at all, for,
as we have seen, he is invisible when at his
greatest possible distance from us, being
then on the far side of the sun.</p>

<p>Another cause of Mercury’s apparent
change in brightness is due to the fact that,
in common with Venus, he goes through
phases from crescent to full like the moon.
This is, as we have seen, a result of his shining
only by reflected light and of his orbit’s
being between ours and the sun. If he shone
by his own light, he would be at his nearest
approach to us a very brilliant body indeed.
As it is, his dark side is turned toward us
when he is nearest, and when his full face is
illuminated he is on the far side of the sun.
We see half of his face when he is at greatest
elongation; but he is brightest when we see
less than half, because he is then nearer to
us, and the difference in distance more than
compensates for the difference in illumination.</p>

<p>These phases cannot be seen with the naked
eye, but it requires only a small telescope
to show them, and a very charming little<span class="pagenum" title="104"><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104"></a></span>
moon-like body Mercury is when we see
them. His horns point toward the east
when he is coming toward us and nearing
inferior conjunction, and when he is backing
away from us and going toward greatest
western elongation they point toward the
west. It was through the blunting of one
of these horns when the planet was in certain
positions that a mountainous surface
was suspected, so great is the significance
of small details in observations.</p>

<p>As a mere place from which to view the
other bright bodies Mercury would be far
superior to the earth. He not only has the
sun nearly seven times larger in appearance
at its mean distance than we see it, but, being
himself nearest the sun, all the other planets
are outer planets in relation to him, and all
have their discs fully illuminated.</p>

<p>The earth and the moon, as seen from
Mercury, would show as a splendid pair
of stars circling about each other, the earth
more brilliant than any first-magnitude star,
and the moon of the third magnitude, or
about as bright as Phecda, the star at the
bottom of the bowl of the Big Dipper, just
under the beginning of the handle. The
earth would show a disc of about twenty<span class="pagenum" title="105"><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105"></a></span>
seconds, and the moon one of about eight
seconds, with a distance between them of
about 871 seconds. Some idea of what this
distance is may be had if one knows
Mizar, the star at the bend of the handle
of the Dipper, and its tiny shining attendant,
Alcor. These two stars are 708 seconds
apart. The distance between them is about
equal to one-third of the diameter of the
moon as measured from the earth. It does
not appear to be nearly so much as that,
and some persons have difficulty in separating
the two stars; but the moon is not
only inconstant but deceptive, and owing to
its brilliancy seems always proportionately
larger than it really measures.</p>

<p>Venus would appear from Mercury as
much as four times as large as she seems to
us&mdash;a veritable little moon, and always full,
her size varying slightly as Mercury speeded
back and forth from the farthest to the nearest
point in his orbit, changing the extreme
of the distance between them from one
hundred and ten million to less than twenty-four
million miles. If Mercury needed a
moon, he could well find some consolation
for his lack of it in the presence of the lovely
Venus in his sky.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" title="106"><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106"></a></span></p>


<h3>MERCURY’S SIZE AND THE CONSEQUENCES OF IT</h3>

<p>Mercury is the smallest of all the major
planets. His diameter is about three thousand
miles. It is only about nine hundred
miles greater than that of our moon. The
surface of Mercury is only one-seventh that
of the earth, and his volume only one-twentieth.
Jupiter and Saturn each have a
satellite that is considerably larger.</p>

<p>Mercury would make a splendid satellite
or a giant asteroid, but as a planet seems
hardly to have had a fair chance in life.
For being a small planet means something
more than being constructed on smaller
lines than some others are. It means a difference
in physical development. It means
less power to hold the gases that compose
an atmosphere, which is the cover that shields
the planets from the too burning rays of the
sun and keeps their internal heat from radiating
too quickly into space. It means less
power to resist the tidal friction that the
parent body uses as a brake to retard rotation.
It means a shorter time of activity
in life, and a long, dull, monotonous old age.</p>

<p>The nucleus that was detached from the
great spiral, or the portion of nebula that was<span class="pagenum" title="107"><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107"></a></span>
separated in whatever way from the parent
body, to form Mercury chanced to be a
small one. Being small, it was unable to
add materially to its mass by attracting
other particles to it through the power of
gravitation, as a larger planet might do, and
thus Mercury was doomed to develop with
the limitations that nature’s law has decreed
as inevitable in the small bodies of our solar
system, be they planets, satellites, or asteroids.
Of these limitations the first and most
far-reaching in its effect is the feebleness of
its force of gravity, or power to attract other
bodies.</p>

<p>Mercury’s force of gravity is small. It
is smaller than that of any of the other
planets. It is a little less than one-quarter
that of the earth. The same weight of
feathers that would compose a pillow here
would make a whole feather bed on Mercury.
Any object weighing one hundred pounds
here would weigh only twenty-four there.
The materials composing our earth and all
the planets are held together only by the
force of gravity. The air we breathe would
dart off into space with almost incredible
fleetness if the earth had not sufficient gravitative
force to hold it. Its particles are<span class="pagenum" title="108"><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108"></a></span>
struggling all the time to get beyond this
power. The lightest of them do get beyond
it and are lost, and the less power we have
to hold them the sooner they leave us. The
greater the mass of a body, the rarer the
gases it can hold in its atmosphere, for this
mysterious force which pulls everything
toward the center of a planet depends upon
its mass, or the quantity of material in it.
The planet may be very large because it is
very much expanded. It may be gaseous
even, and its mass would then be very small
in proportion to that of a solid body of the
same size. As it condenses, the particles
draw closer and closer together, the density
increases; but the mass is the same. It is
only the size that diminishes.</p>

<p>So a planet with a small mass starts out in
life with a disadvantage. It not only has
little power to grow by drawing in particles
from its environment, but also has little
power to hold such as by their nature are
volatile and swift of motion, as the molecules
of gases are. The mass of Mercury
is not exactly known. The only way we
have of measuring the masses of the planets
is by their influence through gravitation on
other bodies near them. When a planet has<span class="pagenum" title="109"><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109"></a></span>
satellites, the movements of the satellites tell
the story, and by mathematical calculation
the amount of material in the planet can be
determined. But Mercury has no satellite,
and the only way to determine his mass is
by observation of his influence on Venus,
and on an occasional comet which passes
near enough to be disturbed by the planet.
The particular comet which has been useful
in determining the mass of Mercury is
Encke’s. On passing near the sun it comes
sometimes near Mercury, and the pull it
has repeatedly received from that little
planet on such occasions is thought to be
largely responsible for the comet’s having
become a part of the solar system. The
changes in its orbit caused by these encounters
show the power of Mercury, and
hence the mass.</p>

<p>In these ways the mass of Mercury has
been found, with reasonable belief in its accuracy,
to be about three one-hundredths
that of the earth. Yet there are, indeed,
considerable differences regarding it among
astronomers. The exact figures are not important
to any but the close student. It is
certain that the mass of Mercury is very
small&mdash;so small that the planet probably<span class="pagenum" title="110"><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110"></a></span>
never had much atmosphere, and almost
undoubtedly has none to speak of now.
The planet could not hold any molecule
moving faster than two and forty-five
one-hundredths miles a second, and few
gases move as slowly as this. The proportion
of light that Mercury reflects to
that which he receives also points to a probable
scarcity of atmosphere. If he had an
atmosphere, it would have clouds. Clouds
have a very high reflecting power, giving
out about seventy-two per cent. of the light
that falls upon them. Mercury reflects only
fourteen per cent. of the light he receives,
which shows at least a lack of clouds, and
something more. It indicates a hard, dark,
almost metallic surface, and a very considerable
density. Density, however, is the
only quality in the possession of which Mercury
seems to occupy a middle ground among
the planets, being slightly less dense than
either Venus, or Mars, or the earth. The
earth is the densest of all the planets, and it
is about one-third more dense than Mercury.
Density is simply the closeness with
which the particles composing a body are
packed together. A piece of gold, for example,
is denser than a piece of iron of the same size.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" title="111"><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111"></a></span></p>


<h3>WHAT THE SUN DOES FOR MERCURY</h3>

<p>It is probable that Mercury has no alternations
of light and darkness, causing day
and night such as we know them. That is,
the planet does not rotate on its axis in such
a way as to turn first one side and then
the other toward the sun as the earth does.
In this, as in some other things, Mercury
must accept the fate that overtakes many
other small bodies which revolve around
large ones&mdash;that of our moon, for instance,
and the satellites of some of the other
planets. Working under the law of gravitation,
which gives such power to the large
bodies, the sun has so retarded the rotation
of Mercury that the planet now makes but
one rotation on its axis during one circuit
around that central body, and so keeps
always the same face toward the sun. Some
astronomers do not regard this as having
been wholly proved; but all the later observations
of Mercury strongly indicate that
it is the fact, and it is coming to be more
and more regarded as established.</p>

<p>But, even if this is the predicament into
which Mercury has come, the planet is prob<span class="pagenum" title="112"><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112"></a></span>ably
not in so bad a plight as many another
body to which the same sort of thing has
happened. The extreme eccentricity of his
orbit, which has given him the true mercurial
temperament, resulting in sprightliness,
agility, and changeableness, is accountable
for some mitigating circumstances. The
sun may hold him so that he cannot turn his
face away from that luminary; but it cannot
keep him from rotating on his axis at a uniform
rate of speed, and from this, combined
with the vagaries caused by his eccentric
orbit, come some interesting things.</p>

<p>Since Mercury is less than two-thirds as
far from the sun at perihelion as he is at
aphelion, there is a corresponding variation
in his rate of speed. When he is nearest the
sun, at perihelion, he darts along at the rate
of thirty-five miles a second; at aphelion, when
he is farthest from the sun, he travels only
twenty-three miles a second. Twenty-three
miles in one second is not exactly a snail’s
pace, terrestrially considered, and it is faster
than the earth moves at any time; but the
planet was named Mercury because of his
swiftness, and we would not expect much
lagging even when he is moving at his slowest
gait. This difference in speed in different<span class="pagenum" title="113"><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113"></a></span>
parts of his orbit causes what is called the
librations of Mercury. When he is traveling
at his swiftest pace he gets a little ahead
of his rotation, the speed of which is uniform,
and thus throws the sunlight somewhat
farther around on one side. When his
speed decreases, he falls behind his time of
rotation, and thus gets a little more sunlight
on the other side. Thus, during each revolution
he juggles the sunlight a little farther
around him than he could if he were a more
steady-going planet.</p>

<p>These librations result in there being two
strips on the surface of Mercury&mdash;one on
each side&mdash;which undoubtedly have a day
and night, varying in length in the different
parts of the strips. The part that lies nearest
the illuminated side of the planet has
alternate periods of sunlight and darkness,
each of considerable duration, while that
part nearest the dark side has merely a
glimmer of sunlight every eighty-eight days,
which is Mercury’s sidereal year, or the time
required for him to make one revolution
around the sun. These two strips on which
the light varies comprise about one-eighth
of the surface of Mercury. One half of his
entire surface is always light, and of the other<span class="pagenum" title="114"><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114"></a></span>
three-eighths are always dark. It is this
dark, cold side that is turned toward us
when Mercury is nearest to us.</p>

<p>It is possible that on those parts of Mercury
where the sunlight and darkness are
unstable there may be something resembling
a tolerable temperature. They are something
more than a thousand miles in breadth,
and perhaps near the center of them the sun
may give heat sufficient to enliven and yet
not burn. More than likely, they are alternately
scorched and frozen. For it takes
more than the mere presence of sunlight to
make a climate tolerable. Atmosphere is
what is necessary, and we have seen that
Mercury has probably lost practically all
his atmosphere long, long ago. An atmosphere
absorbs much of the radiant energy
that comes from the sun before it reaches
the more solid parts of a planet, and it also
acts as a blanket in preventing the too rapid
escape of such heat as the planet may have
acquired. Thus it has the doubly beneficent
office of tempering the rays that would otherwise
be scorching and of hindering a radiation
that would leave the planet stiffened
and frozen.</p>

<p>Stiffened and frozen is what the dark side<span class="pagenum" title="115"><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115"></a></span>
of Mercury undoubtedly is. The sun has
never shone upon it since Mercury became
a solid body. All the inherent heat it had
has long since passed off into space, and its
temperature must be somewhere near the
absolute zero. The absolute zero is the
point in temperature where all known substances
become solid. It is more than 450°
below the Fahrenheit zero, or more than
350° lower than any temperature recorded
in our arctic regions&mdash;a degree of cold unthinkable
to any but the scientist.</p>

<p>On the other side of Mercury the heat is
beyond anything we have any notion of.
With an equal atmosphere it would receive
from the sun six thousand times as much
light and heat as Neptune on an equal space,
and, on an average, seven times as much as
the earth. At Mercury’s distance from the
sun his hot side would be more than 300°
above zero, if there were absolutely no atmospheric
protection. Even though tempered
by a thin atmosphere, as it may be,
the heat on this side is still probably enough
to boil away any water that might be there
and to change some other substances from
what we regard as their normal state.</p>

<p>Stability, at least, is a quality of the hot<span class="pagenum" title="116"><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116"></a></span>
and the cold side of Mercury. Scorched and
seared and desolate of life, as we know it, the
one side lies under a blazing, dazzling sun.
Cold and hard and bleak, and no less desolate,
the other side turns its face toward the darkness
of space. Thus they will remain until
the end of time. And let us hope that, when
the final catastrophe occurs and a new
nebula is formed, the matter composing
Mercury may find a place in a larger mass,
and in its new incarnation have a fuller and
larger life.</p>

<p>It is the atmosphere also which causes twilight,
as well as the gradual changing from
heat to cold. With no atmosphere, we would
drop from full daylight to the darkness of
starlight at the setting of the sun. So, with
the thin air that Mercury probably has (if
he has any), the two zones which are alternately
light and dark, and hot and cold, are
not much better off than the parts which are
permanently either light or dark. They are
plunged alternately from the temperature
and light of the hot side of Mercury to the
temperature of the cold side, with few gradations
to prepare them for such extremes.
Thus the only part of the planet that might
be expected to have any variations of sea<span class="pagenum" title="117"><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117"></a></span>sons
fulfils the expectation with little satisfaction.</p>

<p>The only changes in climate which may
have an appreciable effect are mainly those
caused by the eccentricity of Mercury’s
orbit, which carries him so near the sun at
certain times and so comparatively far away
at others. When he is nearest the sun he
receives more than twice as much heat and
light as when he is farthest away. At
aphelion he receives four times as much
heat and light as the earth. At perihelion
the amount of heat and light is increased to
more than nine times that of the earth.
Since it takes Mercury a little more than
twelve weeks to make one revolution around
the sun, he passes from nearest distance
to farthest, or the reverse, every six weeks.
And thus, as viewed from the planet, the
sun expands gradually for six weeks until
it has increased its diameter two and one-half
times, and the next six weeks it diminishes
in the same proportion. At such times,
of course, the amount of heat is more or less
according to the planet’s distance from the
sun; but all the time it is very great.</p>

<p>Moreover, it is believed that the axis on
which Mercury rotates stands perpendicular<span class="pagenum" title="118"><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118"></a></span>
to his orbit. This being the case, there would
be on Mercury no change of seasons such as
the earth has. The earth’s axis is inclined
a little more than twenty-three degrees to
its orbit, and from this we get the sun’s rays
in a great variety of directions and different
degrees of obliquity, causing the seasons, as
we know them, in grateful variation. With
the axis perpendicular, as it probably is in
the case of Mercury, the sun’s rays fall on
the face of the planet always with the same
degree of directness, the only relief from
their greatest heat being when the planet
backs away from the sun every six weeks,
and when in his librations he turns first one
sun-burned cheek and then the other toward
the coolness of space.</p>

<p>Thus we must regard the smallest of our
family of planets, Mercury, as always the
dwarf among us, with never a fair chance
to develop a rich and luscious life according
to our ideas of such a life. Beaten by the
sun’s hard rays, and with no sufficient atmospheric
protection; pulling always at his
tether, but held firmly with his face to the
center; circling at times with mercurial
swiftness and thus cheating the sun into
sending its rays farther toward the dark,<span class="pagenum" title="119"><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119"></a></span>
cold side of him than it otherwise would, and
with all his defects from a human point of
view, we may still regard him as a right merry,
roguish little planet, after all. He may be
prematurely aged, he may have missed many
experiences that the larger planets are having,
he may have a long time to wait for
the final change that will reunite us all;
but he is not lying in sluggish inactivity
until it comes.</p>

<p>In view of the fact that he is the only
planet that twinkles, may it not suggest,
when we see his ruddy face peering through
the thick atmospheric mists near our horizon,
that the impish little body is winking
at us, and that it may be with planets as it
is with people: they may not always be in
an unfortunate plight because their fate is
different from ours?</p>


<h3>TRANSITS</h3>

<p>Occasionally Mercury passes at inferior
conjunction between us and the disc of the
sun, appearing like a black spot against the
sun, and thus makes what we call a transit.
Because the planet is so small, his transit
across the sun cannot be seen with the naked<span class="pagenum" title="120"><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120"></a></span>
eye; but it is an interesting phenomenon
to those who can view it with a telescope,
though, apparently, astronomers do not regard
it as having any great scientific importance.
It is during a transit, however,
that we watch for confirmation of the theories
concerning Mercury’s atmosphere, which, if
it were a reality, would show a diffused light
about the planet; and until this question is
settled beyond any dispute it will always
come up at the time of a transit of Mercury.
At nearly every transit some observer sees
these indications of an atmosphere; but the
better the telescope, the less they seem to
be seen. Hence it is probable that there is
an illusion somewhere either of eye, or instrument,
or mind, and that the majority opinion,
which accords to Mercury practically
no atmosphere, is about the correct one.</p>

<p>These transits occur at intervals of seven,
thirteen, or forty-six years, according to the
position of the earth. They would occur
every time that Mercury passed inferior conjunction
if the earth’s orbit and that of
Mercury were in exactly the same plane.
But the orbit of Mercury, we have seen, is
tilted out of the plane of the ecliptic, which
marks our orbit, seven degrees, so that the<span class="pagenum" title="121"><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121"></a></span>
only time the earth and the planet are anywhere
nearly in the same plane is when they
are at or near the points where their orbits
cross each other.</p>

<p>The earth is near the two points where
Mercury crosses the ecliptic about May 8th
and November 9th, so that transits can occur
only near these dates. Mercury passes
these points four times every year, or once
in each revolution around the sun. But the
earth is not always there at the same time,
and it is because of this that transits occur
only in periods of seven, thirteen, or forty-six
years. They occur more frequently in
November than in May. The last transit
was in November, 1907. The next will be
on November 7, 1914, and there will not be
another in November until 1927, an interval
of thirteen years. But at the point where
the May transits occur there will be one on
May 7, 1924.</p>

<h3>VENUS</h3>


<p>Of all the planets lovely Venus is the one
that is best known and most admired.
It far exceeds all the other planets in brilliancy
and beauty when as an evening star
it hangs in gracious silvery softness above
the sun, which has just passed below the
horizon; and it is not less surpassing in
loveliness when as a morning star it comes
into view shortly before the sun rises, its
glowing face still silvery and bright, but
yet tinged with the rosy flush of the eastern
morning sky.</p>

<p>In either position it never twinkles as
Mercury sometimes does, but shines so
steadily and softly that at times its disc
can almost be seen with the naked eye, and
it has such brilliancy that its light can often
be seen in the daytime, if one knows when
and how to look for the planet. At its
brightest it frequently throws a light suffi<span class="pagenum" title="123"><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123"></a></span>ciently
strong to cast a shadow, as one may
easily prove by holding a book or some other
opaque object between Venus and a white
background, such as the wall of a white
house. It is six times as bright as the brightest
of all the fixed stars, Sirius, the beautiful
dog-star, which we see in winter chasing
across the southern skies after Orion.</p>

<p>Venus’s superior brilliancy is due in part
to the fact that it comes nearer to the earth
than any other planet; but it is also intrinsically
brighter than any of the others.
From equal areas it reflects almost four times
as much light as Mercury and three times as
much as Mars.</p>


<h3>WHEN AND WHERE TO SEE VENUS</h3>

<p>When Venus appears in the sky she is not
often mistaken for any other planet. Among
all the planets she is the most readily recognized
and the easiest to find. This is due
largely to her extreme brilliancy and a peculiar
silvery appearance that none of the
other planets have; but also, in part, to her
limited range in the sky, and her favorable
situation for observation. Unlike Mercury,
she is far enough away from the sun to be<span class="pagenum" title="124"><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124"></a></span>
seen above the horizon for as much as three
hours after sunset, and is then sufficiently
high in the heavens to be seen free from
the vapors of the atmosphere at the horizon.
Yet, being one of the inferior planets, with
her orbit smaller and nearer the sun than
that of the earth, she can never get so far
from the sun as to be at any uncomfortable
height for viewing, and hence, when she can
be seen at all, is always an obvious bit of
brilliancy and a joy to the beholder. She is
never higher in the sky than forty-five degrees,
which is half-way between the horizon
and the zenith, and is never farther away
from the sun than forty-eight degrees. One
frequently sees a bright planet higher up in
the heavens than this; but it is never Venus
nor Mercury.</p>

<p>We first begin to notice Venus in the evening
sky about six weeks after she has passed
superior conjunction. She is then very near
the sun, and sets a little less than half an
hour after sundown. Evening by evening
she grows gradually brighter, mounts higher
and higher in the sky and, consequently,
sets correspondingly later, until in a little
more than seven months after superior conjunction,
and about six months after we have<span class="pagenum" title="125"><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125"></a></span>
begun to watch her, she reaches her greatest
elongation east from the sun. At that time
she is usually somewhere near forty-five
degrees above the sun, and is a very lovely
and conspicuous object in the evening sky,
setting a little more than three hours after
sundown.</p>

<p>From this point she begins to travel back
toward the sun, still becoming brighter each
evening, because she is really coming nearer
to us; and in about four or five weeks she
attains the greatest brilliancy that she will
have as an evening star during the particular
revolution she is making. About twelve
days after her brightest she will reach the
point where she seems to be stationary for a
time. This is when she is about to overtake
us in our journey around the sun. After
a short pause she will move on gradually,
her course among the stars then being retrograde
or westward; but what we most
notice is that she is drawing nearer to the
sun, setting earlier each evening, and becoming
more and more difficult to see. At
the end of about three weeks she is in inferior
conjunction, on a line between us and
the sun, and invisible. She has run her
course as an evening star for nine and a<span class="pagenum" title="126"><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126"></a></span>
half months, and has been visible anywhere
from seven to eight months, the time of her
invisibility depending upon the eye of the
observer and the conditions of situation and
atmosphere.</p>

<p>A week or two later we shall find her a
splendid morning star, rising nearly an hour
earlier than the sun. About three weeks
thereafter she will be at her brightest as a
morning star, and will continue to be very
brilliant for some weeks. In about five more
weeks she will have reached her greatest
elongation west of the sun, and will rise
about three hours and a half before dawn.
Then she will begin to retrace her path,
moving eastward, growing smaller all the
time as she goes farther away from us, and
showing a slower apparent movement, which
gives one an agreeable sense of a reluctant
parting, until after a little more than seven
months she will have reached the sun and
will again be in superior conjunction. She
has then been a morning star for nine and
a half months, and has been visible for about
the same length of time that she was when
she shone as an evening star.</p>

<p>This is a brief outline of a typical journey
of Venus through one synodic revolution.<span class="pagenum" title="127"><a name="Page_127" id="Page_127"></a></span>
She began one of these journeys on July 5,
1912, being then in superior conjunction.
During the autumn of this year and the
winter of 1912–13 she may be seen shining
with great brilliancy in the west at sunset,
and a few hours thereafter. Early in November,
1912, she and Jupiter will both be in
Scorpio, where they will approach within
two degrees of each other; and there is no
doubt that their presence will add much
charm to that region of the sky during the
entire autumn.</p>

<p>About the middle of February, 1913,
Venus will appear half-way up to the zenith
at sunset. She will then be at her greatest
distance east of the sun, and will be very
bright; but, though a little nearer the sun,
she will be still brighter shortly after the
middle of March. A month later she will
be invisible, and inferior conjunction will
occur on April 24th. During most of May
and all of June and July she will be a morning
star, and her brilliant beauty will well
repay an early morning outlook. She will
get back to superior conjunction on February
11, 1914, and in that year she will be in an
ideal situation for us to cultivate a more
intimate acquaintance with her. From the<span class="pagenum" title="128"><a name="Page_128" id="Page_128"></a></span>
latter part of March to November, 1914, she
will be the brightest star in the western
evening sky, and will do much to enhance
the beauty of the pleasant summer evenings
of that year. The sturdy, red-faced Mars
will meet her on August 5th, a little more
than a month before greatest eastern elongation,
and might almost kiss her pale cheek
as they pass within one-sixth of a degree
of each other, a distance equal to less than
one-third of the diameter of the moon.</p>

<p>The next long period when Venus will shine
as an evening star will comprise the spring
and early summer of 1916. She will be at her
greatest distance from the sun during the last
week of April, and will not pass from view
until about the first of July. Then again she
will be an evening star, and so seen in the
west during the autumn of 1917 and the
winter of 1917–18, reaching greatest eastern
elongation during the first few days of December,
1917. Her next return to the evening
sky will be for the first eight months of
1919, and the next will be for the winter of
1920–21 and the spring of 1921.</p>

<p>The synodic period of Venus is nearly five
hundred and eighty-four days, or a little
more than one year and seven months.<span class="pagenum" title="129"><a name="Page_129" id="Page_129"></a></span>
That is, the planet returns to the same position
with relation to the sun and the earth
at intervals of about that length. The intervals
do vary, however, as much as a week
or more, owing to the various motions and
situations of the planet and the earth. But
every eight years Venus and the earth come
around to almost exactly the same relative
position with each other and the sun and
the stars, and thus the appearances of Venus
at the various seasons practically repeat
themselves every eight years. The full
splendor that she is to offer us in the summer
of 1914 will be repeated in 1922, just
as that of 1914 will but repeat that which
she showed in 1906. And in each of the
intervening years she will have again the
same appearances that she had eight years
before.</p>

<p>With the following table as a guide, the
appearances of Venus can be followed through
a number of years with sufficient accuracy
for any but a close student of her movements.
The exact dates of elongations and
conjunctions will vary a few days, but for
at least two or three multiples of eight years
not enough to make any material difference
in her various aspects.</p>

<p>The meetings of Venus with the other
planets do not, however, occur with this
delightful regularity. They all are moving
about in their own ways, and engaged in
their own affairs, and only the earth gets
back to repeat the meeting with her in just
eight years. These eight-year cycles are
due to the fact that Venus makes thirteen
revolutions around the sun while the earth
makes eight. Her journey around the sun
requires a little less than two hundred and
twenty-five days (224.70), and the earth
completes its revolution in a little more than
three hundred and sixty-five days (365.25).
So at the end of about two thousand nine
hundred and twenty-two days&mdash;which equals
eight years&mdash;they come into almost exactly
the same relative positions in their orbits
with which they started out, and begin the
cycle anew.</p>


<h3>DISTANCE AND BRILLIANCY</h3>

<p>The mean distance of Venus from the sun
is 67,269,000 miles. Her orbit more nearly
approaches the form of a circle than that of
any other planet. It is, like the orbits of
the other planets, an ellipse, but of such<span class="pagenum" title="132"><a name="Page_132" id="Page_132"></a></span>
small eccentricity that the difference between
her greatest and least distance from
the sun is scarcely more than a million miles.
Light, traveling as it does, at the rate of a
little more than one hundred and eighty-six
thousand miles a second, goes from the sun
to Venus in about six minutes. It takes
something more than eight minutes for light-rays
to come from the sun to us. When
Venus is nearest the earth, her silvery beams
come swiftly across to us in a little more
than two minutes. When she is farthest
from us, the rays of light require a few seconds
more than fourteen minutes to travel
over the distance. She is, when at her
greatest distance, more than one hundred and
thirty-five million miles farther from us than
when at her nearest. This difference is due
not to any great eccentricity in her orbit, or
in that of the earth, such as causes Mercury’s
great variations of distance, but to
the situation of the two bodies in their orbits:
they are nearest together when they are on
the same side of the sun, and farthest apart
when on opposite sides.</p>

<p>Usually at inferior conjunction Venus is a
little more than twenty-five million miles
from the earth. At her nearest possible ap<span class="pagenum" title="133"><a name="Page_133" id="Page_133"></a></span>proach
to us, however, which takes place at
inferior conjunction, when the earth is nearest
the sun and Venus is farthest from it, a
situation which occurs only once or twice in
a century, the distance between us and the
planet is only a little more than twenty-three
million miles. This is nearer than any
other heavenly body ever approaches us,
except the moon and, so far as we now
know, one small asteroid. Also, it is nearer
than Venus comes to any other heavenly
body except perhaps Mercury. Her nearest
approach to that planet is also about
twenty-three million miles.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, our comparative proximity
to this beautiful planet does not much aid
us in learning anything about her personal
peculiarities. Shining only by reflected light,
and being, like Mercury, situated nearer to
the sun than the earth is, when she comes
around to the same side of the sun on which
we are, her unillumined side is turned toward
us, and at the point of very closest approach
she is absolutely invisible to the naked eye.
Through a telescope, however, she can be
seen up to the very point of inferior conjunction.
What we see then is a mere curved
line of light, so thin is the crescent she pre<span class="pagenum" title="134"><a name="Page_134" id="Page_134"></a></span>sents;
but it is always apparent except when
the planet makes a transit. During a transit
she is actually in our line of sight with the
bright disc of the sun, and is neither above
nor below it, as at the ordinary times of
inferior conjunction. The slender crescent
that we ordinarily see offers a very narrow
field for observation.</p>

<p>If there is any one on Venus who is studying
the earth, he has a much easier task than
we have in our effort to learn something
about her. The earth is not only somewhat
larger than the planet, but when the two
bodies are nearest together the disc of the
earth is fully illuminated, and so must show
a splendid face; and then, our atmosphere
probably interferes less with close observation
than that of Venus. This little terrestrial
system would undoubtedly shine as a
magnificent pair of stars if observed from
Venus. At that distance our moon would
appear considerably larger than Venus appears
to us when at superior conjunction,
the earth would seem much larger than
Venus ever does to us, and the distance between
them would seem to be a little more
than the apparent diameter of the full moon
as we see it. The light of the earth must<span class="pagenum" title="135"><a name="Page_135" id="Page_135"></a></span>
cause much more of a shadow than we ever
get from the light of Venus.</p>

<p>It has been suggested that light from the
earth is responsible for a dusky illumination
of the dark side of Venus, which is occasionally
seen, and which enables us to distinguish
her entire outline even when only the merest
line of a crescent is really illuminated. It is
known to be earth-shine that causes what is
apparently the same phenomenon often seen
by us on the moon; but it seems that there
is no reason to think that our earth, at its
distance, would be sufficiently brilliant to
illuminate Venus even so slightly. The
cause of the illumination is not known; but
it is thought that it may have some electrical
origin, probably similar to that of our
aurora.</p>

<p>Venus has the same phases that Mercury
has. She shows her full face when at superior
conjunction, and is then farthest away
and smallest to our view. As she moves
toward us she first becomes gibbous, and
then, at eastern elongation, like a half-moon.
As she comes nearer to inferior conjunction,
and hence nearer to us, she becomes a thinner
and thinner crescent, and as she goes from
inferior to superior conjunction these phases<span class="pagenum" title="136"><a name="Page_136" id="Page_136"></a></span>
are repeated in reverse order. We see less
than half of her face when she is at her
greatest brilliancy, a phase which usually
occurs when she is about forty degrees from
the sun, as she is a few weeks before and after
inferior conjunction. A very small glass
will show the phases of Venus. They have
occasionally been seen without artificial aid
to vision by an exceptionally good eye.
They were not known, however, until they
were discovered by Galileo after the invention
of the telescope in 1610.</p>

</div>

<p>Venus would be many times brighter than
she ever appears if the entire disc of the
planet could be seen when it is nearest to
us. The apparent diameter of the disc at
that time is nearly seven times larger than
when we see it at the planet’s greatest distance
from us. When Venus is in superior
conjunction and farthest from the earth the
disc measures only ten seconds, while at
inferior conjunction its measure is nearly
sixty-seven seconds. The diameter of the
moon is about 1,868 seconds, so one could
string across the diameter of the moon
one hundred and eighty-six such planets as
Venus appears to be when at her smallest,
and only twenty-seven of the size that she<span class="pagenum" title="137"><a name="Page_137" id="Page_137"></a></span>
appears to be when at her largest. Between
these two extremes of size she changes gradually,
day by day, from large to small and
small to large, in ceaseless succession, as she
approaches the earth and recedes from it in
her orbital journey. Apparent diameter is
determined by an actual measurement of the
disc of a planet, and in the case of Venus
indicates nothing as to brightness. When
the apparent diameter is largest she is not
visible to the naked eye.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" title="138"><a name="Page_138" id="Page_138"></a></span></p>


<h3>VENUS’S LIKENESS TO THE EARTH</h3>

<p>The fact that of all the planets Venus most
resembles this good little earth on which
our present lot is cast gives us a strong feeling
of kinship with her, and a more lively
interest in all her affairs than we might otherwise
have. She and the earth are so nearly
of one size that they are often referred to
as twin sisters. There is a difference of less
than three hundred miles in their diameters,
the earth’s diameter measuring 7,917 miles,
and that of Venus 7,629 miles. The surface
of the planet is about ninety-three per
cent. as extensive as that of the earth; its
mass is a little more than eighty per cent.,
and its volume about ninety per cent. as
great as the earth’s. Differing so little in
these particulars, it follows that it must differ
very little in density and gravity. The
earth is the densest of all the planets, and
Venus is only one-tenth less dense than the
earth. Its force of gravity is not quite nine-tenths
that of the earth. A removal from
the earth to Venus would make just a comfortable
reduction in one’s weight. A person
weighing one hundred and seventy-five
pounds here would weigh on Venus one hun<span class="pagenum" title="139"><a name="Page_139" id="Page_139"></a></span>dred
and fifty-four. If through strength of
appetite and weakness of will one should
take on two hundred pounds of too, too solid
flesh here, transportation to Venus would
bring about an instantaneous reduction to
a solid one hundred and seventy-six pounds&mdash;as
much of a reduction as would be compatible
with health.</p>

<p>Venus must have begun her career in
much the same way that the earth began
its career. The nebula that formed her
nucleus was probably nearly the same size
(contained about the same amount of matter)
as that with which the earth began its
existence. The two bodies have succeeded
in capturing about the same amount of
loose material, and their gravity is such that
they can hold within their bounds particles
traveling at about the same rate of speed.
No molecule of gas coming within the range
of Venus’s attraction and traveling more
slowly than six and thirty-seven hundredths
miles per second can escape from Venus,
and the earth can hold only such as move,
when coming within its own attraction,
with a less speed than six and ninety-five
one-hundredths miles per second.</p>

<p>The earth has a moon, and Venus has none;<span class="pagenum" title="140"><a name="Page_140" id="Page_140"></a></span>
but that may be because, like Mercury,
Venus is too near the sun to be permitted
to retain such a luxury. It is likely that
if, in her earlier history, she had within the
limit of her gravitative attraction the nucleus
of a satellite, it would have been taken away
from her by the stronger attraction of the
sun. The same thing would have happened
to us if we had been a little nearer the sun.
And yet in 1645 a moon belonging to Venus
was supposed to have been discovered, and
it was thought to have been seen three times
within the rest of that century, and four times
within the first half of the following century.
The last supposed view of it was in 1791;
it has never been seen since. There is little
doubt that it was an illusion of some kind.
Perhaps, though, Venus has not the same
need of a moon that we have.</p>


<h3>ATMOSPHERE, DAY AND NIGHT, AND SEASONS</h3>

<p>There is no doubt that Venus is in much
better plight than Mercury, the other inferior
planet, in regard to atmosphere. Until
recently no one has questioned the belief
that her atmosphere is very extensive&mdash;twice
as heavy, perhaps, as that of the earth,<span class="pagenum" title="141"><a name="Page_141" id="Page_141"></a></span>
dense, and full of clouds. The luminous
ring about her, shown when she is making
a transit across the face of the sun, points
to a heavy atmosphere; and no less certain
indications of it are given in the faint light
which stretches beyond the termination of
the horns when she is in the crescent phase,
near inferior conjunction. Her very high
reflecting power is also indicative of an
atmosphere laden with clouds. White clouds
form one of the most highly reflecting surfaces
known, and the peculiar brilliancy of
Venus is thought to be in great part due to
the presence of large masses of clouds in her
atmosphere. By the spectroscope, and in
other ways, the water necessary to form
clouds is shown to be abundant in her atmosphere.
Even those astronomers who doubt
the long-current belief in the large extent
of her atmosphere concede an atmosphere
of more or less density, though by one authority
it is characterized as somewhat
gauzy.</p>

<p>There is one vital point concerning the
development of Venus upon which we have
as yet no positive knowledge: the length
of time in which she rotates on her axis.
This is unfortunate, because until her time<span class="pagenum" title="142"><a name="Page_142" id="Page_142"></a></span>
of rotation is known we cannot know much
about her physical condition. Her rotation,
we know, determines the length of her day
and night, or whether, indeed, she has any.
The time of it has been calculated to be anywhere
from a little less than one of our days
to two hundred and twenty-five, the latter
being also the time of her revolution about
the sun. Astronomers of equal reputation
have come to exactly opposite results in their
investigations. To one, the spectroscope has
indicated the short day and night; to another
it has shown no day and night, but a planet
with one face forever toward the sun, like
Mercury. What appeared to be stable surface
markings have been observed, but have
indicated under the eyes of different observers
both the short day and no day at all.
The disc has been measured during a transit,
and shows so little flattening as to indicate
a slow rotation and the long day. On the
other hand, the best authorities think it
unlikely that at the distance of Venus the
sun could so retard the planet’s rotation as
to make it coincide with its time of revolution.
Thus the question is still an open one.</p>

<p>The truth may be that, owing to the density
of her atmosphere, the surface of Venus<span class="pagenum" title="143"><a name="Page_143" id="Page_143"></a></span>
has never been seen at all, and that the apparently
stable markings are but clouds
more or less lacking in stability. The difficulty
of observing Venus will probably make
it impossible to determine this point by
visual observation. It may some day be
settled beyond a doubt by the spectroscope.
In some way it will surely be settled.
Astronomers have too often made possible
what seemed to be impossible for us to doubt
that some one will find a way to discover this
secret of Venus. With them a failure to prove
a conclusion does not mean to abandon the
subject, but to try some other means of getting
at the truth.</p>

<p class="mt2em">The sun viewed from Venus would appear
considerably larger than it does to us. Its
apparent diameter to us is a little more
than thirty-two minutes, while on Venus it
would be something more than thirty-eight
minutes; that is, it would appear about
one-fifth larger on Venus than it does to us.
This is enough to make a material difference
between the two planets in the amount of
heat and light they receive. Venus receives
nearly twice (1.9) as much heat and light
from the sun as we receive, but less than one-<span class="pagenum" title="144"><a name="Page_144" id="Page_144"></a></span>third
as much as Mercury. If she had no
atmospheric protection, there is no question
but that she would have a climate disastrously
warm for a race of beings constituted as
we are. The normal temperature of an unprotected
body at the distance of Venus is
about 158° Fahrenheit (70° Centigrade).</p>

<p>If Venus is finally proved to have no alternations
of day and night, she is still better
off than Mercury, who has practically no
atmosphere to protect him from the intense
heat of the sun. How much protection she
has depends altogether on the extent of her
atmosphere. It is probably not enough to
make the hot side comfortable from our
point of view; and Venus, being undoubtedly
a solid body with no internal heat, the
cold side must be cold beyond anything we
have any conception of. But there may be
a very considerable part on each side that,
owing to the refraction of light by the atmosphere,
is more or less well lighted, and is
also more or less protected by this same
beneficent atmosphere from deadly extremes
of heat and cold. In this situation
there would undoubtedly be lively currents
of air from the heated side to the cooler;
but even these may in some way carry with<span class="pagenum" title="145"><a name="Page_145" id="Page_145"></a></span>
them some tempering effects on the climate,
as we know such currents do here on the
earth.</p>

<p>If it should prove that the length of the
day and night on Venus is something near
that of the earth’s (and this seems not unlikely),
she would then be indeed more like
a twin sister to us. Being next to each other
in our distances from the sun, and of nearly
the same size, differing but little in density,
mass, volume, and force of gravity, with her
greater normal heat probably reduced by
her heavier atmosphere to a temperature
producing climatic conditions not very unlike
ours, and with not very different alternations
of day and night, we might well be
considered more nearly related than any of
the other members of the solar family.</p>

<p>The seasons, however, on Venus and the
earth would not have much resemblance to
each other. The axis of the earth is inclined
to the ecliptic nearly twenty-three and one-half
degrees, so that we receive the sun’s rays
with varying degrees of obliquity during our
yearly journeying around it, which is the
cause of our agreeable change of seasons.
Venus travels with her axis so slightly inclined
to her orbit (a little more than three<span class="pagenum" title="146"><a name="Page_146" id="Page_146"></a></span>
degrees) that each particular parallel of latitude
receives practically the same amount
of sunlight every day in the year, though at
different parallels the sun’s rays strike with
varying degrees of obliquity. However delightful
or disagreeable the climate may be,
there are no changes of seasons to speak of,
and one could find variety only by going
from place to place on the planet. She receives
no compensation for this monotony
by alternately receding from and approaching
the sun as Mercury does, or by librations,
such as he has. Her orbit being, as we have
seen, so nearly circular as to permit of only
small variations in her distance from the
sun, and her axis so nearly perpendicular to
her orbit, it follows that she has nothing to
mark the year; and, whether she turns on her
axis many times or only once during a revolution,
life on Venus would be very monotonous
to any one accustomed to our delightful
variety of climate and seasons. Still,
there is nothing in this monotony to prevent
Venus from being a fairly comfortable habitation
in some parts for such beings as inhabit
the earth. The only real obstacle to habitability
on Venus would be her lack of rotation
and all that it involves.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" title="147"><a name="Page_147" id="Page_147"></a></span></p>

<p>Since we are not sure that we can see the
surface of Venus, we cannot say what that
surface is. Nevertheless, there is some reason
to suspect that we would find there
mountains of vast height. Certain irregularities
have been observed at times, of a
kind to indicate mountains covered with
snow, extending beyond the clouds. They
have been estimated to be many miles higher
than any mountains we have on earth, their
height depending somewhat upon the temperament
of the observer. But inasmuch
as these same high mountains have sometimes
been thought to be only masses of
clouds, it seems hardly safe to pronounce
definitely upon them.</p>


<h3>TRANSITS</h3>

<p>On rare occasions, when Venus is in inferior
conjunction, she makes a transit, and can
then be seen as a black dot moving over the
bright face of the sun. Transits can occur
only when the earth and the planet are near
the point where their orbits cross each other.
The earth is at this point every year on
June 7th and December 7th; but the orbit
of Venus is such that she is there on the<span class="pagenum" title="148"><a name="Page_148" id="Page_148"></a></span>
proper dates only four times in a period of
two hundred and forty-three years. In
every two hundred and forty-three years
four transits take place. They occur in
pairs, eight years apart, and in the same
month. If a pair occur in June, it will be
one hundred and five and one-half years
after the last one of the pair until we have
the first of the December pair of transits.
After that it will be one hundred and twenty-one
and a half years until we have the first
of another pair of June transits.</p>

<p>The first transit of Venus that was scientifically
observed was in December, 1639.
It was the last of a December pair, there
having been a transit eight years before, in
December, 1631. One hundred and twenty-one
and a half years later, in 1761, a June
transit occurred, and in 1769 another one
took place in June. Then there were no
more for one hundred and five and one-half
years, when we had a December pair
in 1874 and 1882. The next ones will be in
June, 2004 and 2012.</p>

<p>Great importance was attached to those
transits that occurred in 1874 and 1882,
because they were expected to be useful in
determining with greater exactness the dis<span class="pagenum" title="149"><a name="Page_149" id="Page_149"></a></span>tance
of the sun. Extensive preparations
were made for scientific observation of them;
but the results were not satisfactory, largely
because the atmosphere of Venus prevented
her from showing a sharp outline at the
moment of entering upon and of leaving the
face of the sun. The main scientific value
of a transit of Venus now is in the opportunity
it may offer to investigate the nature
of her atmosphere. Even though that interesting
question may have been practically
settled before another transit takes place,
it will be important to know to what degree
the phenomena observed at the next transit
confirm the decision.</p>

<p class="mt2em">On account of the surpassing brilliancy of
Venus, the brightest of all the heavenly
bodies after the sun and moon, she was to
the ancients the most important of all the
stars and planets. She was the supreme
evening and morning star. As evening star
she was known as Hesperus, or Vesper; as
a morning star she was called Phosphorus, or
Lucifer, and under all these names she is
frequently mentioned in Greek and Latin
and kindred literatures.</p>

<p>The symbol of Venus is ♀, a figure which<span class="pagenum" title="150"><a name="Page_150" id="Page_150"></a></span>
is nothing more than the conventionalized
form of a looking-glass, an article that is
often pictured in the hands of the goddess
for whom our beautiful planet was named.
In her general aspect she is as placidly splendid
and charming as ever a goddess could
be, and it is not strange that the happy ears
that could hear such strains should find her,
as they did, singing a rich contralto in the
music of the spheres. Jupiter and Saturn,
under this mythological apportionment, sang
bass, Mars took care of the tenor strains,
and the high soprano was carried by our
little dwarf Mercury.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" title="151"><a name="Page_151" id="Page_151"></a></span></p>




<h2>XII</h2>

<h3>MARS</h3>


<p>The planet that varies most in the beauty
of its aspect is Mars. It is as much as
fifty times brighter when it is nearest to us
than it is at its greatest distance from us.
At its brightest it is many times more brilliant
than any of the first-magnitude stars;
but when it leaves our neighborhood and
goes far off into space in its journey around
the sun, its glory is so dimmed that it becomes
not brighter than an ordinary second-magnitude
star, such as the pole-star, and
less brilliant than the brightest stars in the
Big Dipper.</p>

<p>These extreme changes of brightness are
due not so much to any great distance that
Mars goes from us in comparison with other
planets as to its coming so very near to us
at times. It is, after all, a small body, and
no great distance, as heavenly distances go,
is required to make it show so. But the<span class="pagenum" title="152"><a name="Page_152" id="Page_152"></a></span>
eccentricity of its orbit brings it sometimes
very near us, and its near approaches are
at a time when we can see its entire disc, and
not a mere crescent, such as we see when
Venus is nearest to us. Mars does not come
quite so near to us as Venus comes, but
when he is in the best position to be seen
he is much nearer than she is when in her
best position. For we have seen that Venus
is brightest before she reaches her nearest
position to us, while Mars is brightest when
he is at his nearest to us. When Venus is at
greatest elongation she is three times farther
away than Mars is at his nearest.</p>


<h3>HOW TO IDENTIFY MARS</h3>

<p>But with all his variations in brilliancy
and beauty Mars remains ever a charming,
rosy-hued planet, shining always with a
steady, clear light, and when once we have
come to know him is not easily mistaken
for any other planet, or for any of the brilliant
stars that may more or less resemble him in
color. Red in varying degrees of intensity
is, perhaps, the most obviously distinguishing
mark of Mars; but his own characteristics
are never more distinct than when his<span class="pagenum" title="153"><a name="Page_153" id="Page_153"></a></span>
path takes him into the region of the two
best-known red stars in the heavens. These
are Antares, the glowing star in the constellation
Scorpio, which we see in the southern
sky during the summer, and ruddy
Aldebaran, which shines in the head of
Taurus and under the Pleiades through the
bright wintry nights. On every journey
around the skies Mars passes near these two
stars. They are both in the constellations
of the zodiac, and are often quite near to
Mars, as well as to the other planets and the
moon. The stars, though of the same color
as Mars, are much more jewel-like than the
planet. Mars is less sparkling. When it is
small, it shows a placid, rosy little disc, without
much gaiety, and not in any way suggesting
anything martial; but at its largest,
it has a distinctly flame-like aspect, which
easily suggests why it was named for the
god of war.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 675px;">
<img src="images/i_166.jpg" width="675" height="400" alt="" />
<div><p class="tac">THE TWO PHASES OF MARS</p>

<p class="tac">We see its full face when it is opposite the sun. When half-way between opposition and conjunction it becomes gibbous, as shown
in the photograph on the right. These photographs were made at the Mt. Wilson Observatory.</p></div>
</div>

<p>Mercury is the only planet that in color
even suggests Mars, and for Mercury it
can never be mistaken after one has once
seen the two planets. Mercury, we know,
is always very near the sun; but when visible
at all is, even in that unfavorable situation,
always as bright as a first-magnitude star.<span class="pagenum" title="154"><a name="Page_154" id="Page_154"></a></span>
Mars is near the sun, to our view, only when
it is approaching conjunction, and it is then
so far from us that it always appears as a
rather small star, and, while never insignificant,
is, in this situation, quite inconspicuous
even as compared with the rarely
visible Mercury.</p>

<p>On seeing a planet, then, sufficiently high
above the horizon to attract one’s attention,
one may be sure that it is Mars if it is red,
and equally sure that it is not Mars if it
does not show this color. Under certain
atmospheric conditions the sun, moon, and
all the planets sometimes appear red when
they are very near the horizon; but in this
situation there is always something other
than color that marks them.</p>

<p>If its color is not a sufficient mark by which
to identify Mars, a still further difference
between it and the stars is its markedly
rapid movement. A single night will make
a sufficient change in its position to show the
planet as a wanderer. On an average, it
travels over about four-tenths of a degree
in the heavens in one day. This equals more
than half the diameter of the moon, a change
of position sufficiently great to be easily
detected.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" title="155"><a name="Page_155" id="Page_155"></a></span></p>


<h3>WHEN AND WHERE MARS MAY BE SEEN</h3>

<p>Unlike Mercury and Venus, which are
never far from the sun, and can be seen only
for a comparatively short time either early
in the morning or in the evening, and are
never very high up in the skies, Mars may
be situated so that it can be seen at any time
of the night, and also at any distance from
the sun. When it is in opposition it rises
just as the sun sets, and is then in view
all night. At this time it is nearer, larger,
and brighter than at any other time in the
particular revolution it is then making, and,
consequently, is in the best position to be
viewed by us that it will have during that
revolution.</p>

<p>Oppositions differ, however, in different
revolutions, and some show us the planet
more splendidly brilliant than it appears at
others. The oppositions at which Mars
shows most brilliant take place, fortunately,
in the summer and early autumn&mdash;the seasons
which are most agreeable for outdoor
observation. He is then traveling through
that region of the sky, sparse in stars, that
lies between Sagittarius and Aries; and, since
the ecliptic there runs rather low in the sky,<span class="pagenum" title="156"><a name="Page_156" id="Page_156"></a></span>
he can easily be observed at any time in the
night without any neck-breaking postures.</p>

<p>These favorable oppositions occur in the
summer because the earth is in line in the
latter part of August with that point in the
orbit of Mars where the planet makes its
nearest approach to the sun. Oppositions
never occur when Mars is exactly at that
point; but they do occur when he is very
near it, and at such times we see him in his
greatest glory. This happens once every
fifteen or seventeen years. But at any summer
or early-autumn opposition Mars is
not very far from this nearest point to the
sun, so that at any oppositions during these
seasons he is very brilliant and almost as
bright as when he is at his best.</p>

<p>The earth is in line in the winter with that
part of Mars’s orbit which carries him farthest
from the sun, and at opposition then
he is much less bright than at the summer
oppositions. He is at the same time in
those constellations which pass nearly overhead
in the sky, and cannot be quite so comfortably
seen at all times in the night as he
can be in the summer. The very best and
most brilliant oppositions occur in the
latter part of August or in the early part of<span class="pagenum" title="157"><a name="Page_157" id="Page_157"></a></span>
September; the least favorable ones occur
in February. The others vary in brilliancy
according to their distance from these favorable
and unfavorable dates, all the summer
ones being quite brilliant, and all the winter
ones much less so. At any opposition,
though, however unfavorable, the planet is
much nearer to us and much brighter than
when in conjunction.</p>

<p>It is worth one’s while, even at some inconvenience,
to see Mars at whatever time
he is in opposition, for he is a delight to the
observer, and always notable in the part of
the skies through which he is then passing.
There are some aspects of the planet that
are so charming at a winter opposition that
it is a positive loss not to have seen him at
such times. He is more isolated and conspicuous
in the summer; but he fits well in
that gay company of winter stars that shine
more brilliantly than any others, and we
can easily feel something akin to family
pride as we watch him moving so graciously
among them.</p>

<p>Mars makes a complete circuit of the skies,
and comes back into the same position with
relation to the sun and the earth on an
average every seven hundred and eighty days,<span class="pagenum" title="158"><a name="Page_158" id="Page_158"></a></span>
which makes his synodic period longer than
that of any other planet. Owing to the
great eccentricity of his orbit, and his consequent
unequal motion in the various parts
of it, the synodic period varies as much as
thirty-five or thirty-six days. One cannot
say, therefore, without computation of some
length, just exactly how many days will
elapse between any two single oppositions.</p>

<p>For mere purposes of naked-eye observation
the variations in the synodic period of
Mars do not make any difference, for the
planet is in view practically all night for
many nights before and after opposition,
with changes of brightness too small to be
noticed by an untrained eye. For at least
two months at the time of opposition it has
almost the same aspect to us. At that time
it is always in the east early in the evening,
and shines all night. For nearly nine
months afterward it is visible and conspicuous
in the evening sky, appearing each
evening nearer and nearer to the western
horizon, until finally, in a little more than a
year after opposition, it passes behind the
sun and becomes a morning star. But, as it
then rises before the sun and passes across
the heavens in the daytime, it is invisible<span class="pagenum" title="159"><a name="Page_159" id="Page_159"></a></span>
to us. It is pleasant, however, at such times
to know that as the sun passes across the
skies in its daily journey Mars is up there,
within a certain distance from it, making the
same journey with it, beaming down upon
us with the same lively light that it shows
at night, and could be as well seen at any
time but for the too dazzling rays of the
sun.</p>

<p>Mars will be in conjunction in November
of this year (1912), and will not be visible
in the evening during 1913 until toward the
end of the year. The next opposition after
the publication of this book will occur in
January, 1914. From that time until the
following autumn the planet may be seen
in the evening. In 1915 Mars will not be
visible in the evening sky until late in the
year. After November it will be in the east
in the evening, rising earlier each evening,
until at opposition, early in 1916, it will rise
at sunset and will be visible in the evening
during the entire summer and autumn of
that year, but will not be extraordinarily
bright. In 1917 it will be again invisible
in the evening. In 1918 it will be in opposition
in the early spring, and will shine in
the evening all the rest of that year. It<span class="pagenum" title="160"><a name="Page_160" id="Page_160"></a></span>
will not be visible in the evening in 1919,
but will be in opposition again in the latter
part of April, 1920, and will shine in the
evening all of that year and the early part
of the next, when it will again disappear
from evening view and will not emerge
again until it is nearing a fine opposition
that will take place just at the beginning of
the summer of 1922. The planet will then
be in the constellation Scorpio, not far from
Antares, and this will afford an excellent
opportunity to see these two ruddy bodies
near together.</p>

<p>In 1924 there will be an exceptionally
brilliant opposition, which will occur during
the last week of August, and the planet will
then be about as brilliant as it ever appears,
and will be very favorably situated for observation
in the constellation Pisces. We
shall then see Mars in the flame-like phase
of his beauty, and he will dominate the evening
sky during the whole of that summer.
At oppositions such as this one Mars is more
favorably situated for observation from the
earth than any other heavenly body except
the moon.</p>

<p>The next oppositions will take place the
last week in October, 1926, in December,<span class="pagenum" title="161"><a name="Page_161" id="Page_161"></a></span>
1928, January, 1931, early March, 1935, the
middle of May, 1937; and then we will have
two more splendidly brilliant oppositions in
July, 1939, and early October, 1941, respectively.</p>

<p>During the years that Mars does not appear
in the evening we need not be deprived
of a sight of the planet if we will look for
it in the morning sky. A few months after
conjunction it may be seen as a morning
star, rising shortly before the sun. It rises
earlier each morning, and hence can be seen
each morning for a longer time. After its
hour of rising has reached midnight it
then passes into the evening sky and rises
earlier each evening until it reaches opposition.</p>

<p>The movement of Mars among the stars,
as we see it, is generally toward the east, and
we can see by looking that it changes its
place among the constellations in that direction,
going from Aries to Taurus, from
Taurus to Gemini, and so on. On each
side of opposition, however, the planet appears
for a few weeks to be moving westward
among the stars. This is the retrograde
motion which an outer planet appears
to have when we are overtaking and passing<span class="pagenum" title="162"><a name="Page_162" id="Page_162"></a></span>
it, and which has been explained in the chapters
on the movements of the planets.</p>


<h3>SIZE, ATMOSPHERE, AND TEMPERATURE</h3>

<p>In size Mars is one of the smallest members
of our solar family. Its mass is a little
more than one-ninth that of the earth, and
its entire surface is only about one-third as
great as ours. It is the merest trifle more
dense than Mercury, but only about sixty-six
one-hundredths as dense as the earth.
Its force of gravity is about thirty-six one-hundredths
as powerful as that of the earth.
A man weighing two hundred pounds here
would be relieved of about one hundred and
twenty-four pounds of his weight if transported
to Mars, weighing there only seventy-six
pounds, which would greatly increase his
efficiency if he were in other respects the
same.</p>

<p>It would necessarily follow that Mars,
having such small force of gravity, could not
long retain a heavy atmosphere, even if it
had set out with such a one. No molecule
of gas moving at a greater speed than three
and thirteen-hundredths miles a second could
be held by Mars in its atmosphere, and so<span class="pagenum" title="163"><a name="Page_163" id="Page_163"></a></span>
much as it may have had of the rarer gases
which move with great rapidity must have
escaped long ago. But it did not begin life
with an atmosphere heavy in proportion to
that which the larger planets have. We
have seen, in the case of Mercury, that being
one of the small planets entails many restrictions
in development. Such planets not
only lose their atmosphere more quickly than
the larger ones, but it is less dense to begin
with. The atmosphere of Mars is probably
no denser than we have at the tops of our
highest mountains, more than likely not
even so dense as that. There is some water
vapor, and there are a few clouds most of
the time; but in the main the atmosphere
is so clear and thin that we can without any
doubt see the actual surface of the planet.
It is not certain that the clouds we see are
formed from water vapor, as clouds of the
ordinary kind are. It has been suggested
that they may be simply dust-clouds. But
this is as yet not much more than a suggestion,
and nothing convincing has been offered
to substantiate the idea. Even dust-clouds
would need currents of air to create and
carry them; so, whether dust or vapor, the
presence of clouds implies an atmosphere.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" title="164"><a name="Page_164" id="Page_164"></a></span></p>

<p>The famous white polar caps, which furnish
so many news items to the journals,
are also of uncertain origin, and their true
nature can be determined only by a fuller
knowledge of the atmosphere of Mars.
They appear in the winter season on the
planet and disappear in its summer, so there
seems to be no doubt that they are dependent
in some way on the temperature in the polar
regions of Mars. If they are hoar-frost or
snow, they are condensations of water vapor;
and, in that case, when they disappear there
must be sufficient heat to melt them. It has
been contended that the sun’s rays fall too
obliquely on the poles of Mars to melt more
than a few inches of snow, but that the
caps may be light snow or frost, and thus
capable of being dissolved by even such
oblique rays of sunlight as they receive.
Also it has been suggested that the deposit
resembling snow may be carbon dioxide,
which condenses into a white substance at
a temperature more than a hundred degrees
(-109° Fahr.) lower than is necessary to
produce snow and melts at a correspondingly
low temperature. What the nature of
the phenomenon seen at the poles of Mars
is depends largely upon what the tempera<span class="pagenum" title="165"><a name="Page_165" id="Page_165"></a></span>ture
is; and the temperature in turn is dependent
in some measure on the density and
constitution of the atmosphere, as well as
the planet’s distance from the sun.</p>

<p>The normal temperature of an unprotected
body at the distance of Mars from the sun
is about thirty-two degrees blow zero (Fahrenheit);
and since we know Mars has no
dense atmosphere to retain the heat it acquires,
it is natural to suppose the existence
there of a very low temperature, and one
incompatible with our ideas of life and
growth. The most favorable conclusions do
not place the mean temperature higher than
forty-eight degrees Fahrenheit. It is certain
that the planet must be subjected to
great extremes of temperature within its
range, since its filmy robe of atmosphere cannot
protect it to any extent from the direct
rays of the sun during the day, nor prevent
the heat from escaping with great rapidity
at night; so that, whatever heat it may gain
in the daytime, it probably loses much of it
during the night. Until we know more of
the constitution of the atmosphere of Mars
we can know nothing certainly about its
temperature beyond the fact that it is much
colder than ours and more subject to varia<span class="pagenum" title="166"><a name="Page_166" id="Page_166"></a></span>tions.
Anything much more definite than
this is speculative at present. But with all
the observation that is now given to Mars,
and with the always increasing facilities for
the work, many uncertainties regarding the
planet are likely to be made clear before
long. The spectroscope will probably be
the final resort for facts concerning the
atmosphere.</p>


<h3>DISTANCE AND BRILLIANCY</h3>

<p>Mars is, on an average, about one and a
half times farther from the sun than we are.
Its mean distance is, in round numbers,
one hundred and forty-one million miles;
but, since its orbit is very eccentric&mdash;more
eccentric than that of any other of the
planets except Mercury&mdash;its distance from
the sun varies as much as twenty-six million
miles. At its nearest the planet is a little
more than one hundred and twenty-eight
million miles from the sun. Its greatest distance
from that luminary is one hundred and
fifty-four million miles. At its mean distance
something more than twelve and a
half minutes are required for light to travel
from the sun to the planet.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" title="167"><a name="Page_167" id="Page_167"></a></span></p>

<p>The sun becomes quite a medium-sized
object as viewed from Mars, and must lose
some of the majesty of aspect that it has
to us. Its apparent diameter is about
twenty-one minutes, which would make it
less than two-thirds as large as we see it.
The average amount of light and heat that
it furnishes to that poor, lightly clad little
planet is less than half as much as we receive,
though when the planet is at perihelion
the sun’s radiance is forty per cent. more
powerful than when it is at its greatest
distance from the source of these life-giving
forces.</p>

<p>The eccentricity of the orbit of Mars is
the cause also of his great variations in
distance from us, and hence of his extreme
changes in brilliancy. These changes are
many times greater with reference to the
earth than to the sun. At the planet’s nearest
approach to us it comes a little nearer
than thirty-five millions of miles. This is
when it is in opposition in August. When
opposition occurs in February, it is as much
as sixty-two millions of miles from us; and
when it is in conjunction, and on the other
side of the sun from us, it is sometimes two
hundred and forty-eight million miles dis<span class="pagenum" title="168"><a name="Page_168" id="Page_168"></a></span>tant.
At his nearest approach light leaps
over to us from Mars in about four minutes
and eighteen seconds; at his greatest distance
it cannot reach us in less than twenty-two
minutes. The apparent mean diameter of
Mars is about nine and fifty-six hundredths
seconds, but varies from three and six-tenths
seconds, when the planet is farthest away,
to twenty-five seconds when it is nearest
to us.</p>

<p>While Mars does not exhibit the phases
of the inner planets Venus and Mercury,
by showing a disc sometimes at half-full and
sometimes at crescent it is sufficiently near
us to be, in certain positions, gibbous, or to
show a little less than a full face. When
this occurs Mars is about half-way between
opposition and conjunction, and the earth and
the sun are so situated that we are slightly
to one side of the fully illuminated face of
Mars. This phase, however, is not sufficiently
marked to make any material difference
in the brilliancy of the planet. It is not
apparent without the aid of a telescope.</p>

<p>From Mars the earth shows all the phases
that Venus shows to us. When Mars is
flaming down upon us in his position of
greatest brilliancy we present to him a thin<span class="pagenum" title="169"><a name="Page_169" id="Page_169"></a></span>
crescent. When he sees our full face we
are on the opposite side of the sun from him.
It would be necessary to have a more brilliant
electrical illumination than any we
have yet seen to lighten the dark side of the
earth and exchange signals with Mars
when we are nearest to him&mdash;if, indeed, our
atmosphere would permit from Mars any
view at all of the surface of the earth, which
is not at all certain. In spite of its phases,
the earth must shine on Mars at times in
a very attractive way. It is not so bright,
perhaps, as Venus is to us, nor as we are to
Venus; but with our moon circling about
us we may well be, when in a favorable<span class="pagenum" title="170"><a name="Page_170" id="Page_170"></a></span>
situation, a very interesting double star, the
distance between earth and moon appearing
on Mars about equal to one-fourth of the
apparent diameter of the moon.</p>

</div>


<h3>DAY AND NIGHT, AND SEASONS</h3>

<p>Owing to the undoubted permanent markings
on the surface of Mars, astronomers
have been able to determine the length of
its day with much less likelihood of error
than in the case of any other planet except
the one on which we dwell. It rotates on its
axis in twenty-four hours, thirty-seven minutes,
and twenty-three seconds, which makes
its day nearly forty minutes longer than ours.
In our greed for all too fleeting time we
may feel a little envy of these extra minutes,
which would mean so much to us if added to
our day. But they do not seem so important
when we consider that while Mars is having
six hundred and seventy of these days we
are having six hundred and eighty-seven of
ours, which, after all, seems to give us eighteen
days more of time. Our attitude toward
the situation depends upon the point of
view.</p>

<p>The axis of Mars is inclined to its orbit<span class="pagenum" title="171"><a name="Page_171" id="Page_171"></a></span>
about twenty-four degrees and fifty minutes.
This is but little more than the inclination
of the earth’s axis, which is twenty-three
degrees and twenty-seven minutes. Mars,
therefore, has seasons very much like ours.
They are, however, slightly more marked
than ours, because of the somewhat greater
inclination of the axis of the planet; and
they are nearly double the length of ours,
because it takes Mars nearly two of our
years to make its journey around the sun.
Its seasons, then, are nearly six months
long, while ours are but three. It has frigid,
temperate, and torrid zones, practically the
same as the earth has. Its greatest inequalities
of season are caused by the eccentricity
of its orbit. It is, like the earth, farthest away
from the sun when it is summer in the northern
hemisphere; and in this situation it
travels so much more slowly than when it is
near the sun that summer in its northern
hemisphere is seventy-five days longer than
the same season in the southern hemisphere.
The northern summer and the southern
winter are each three hundred and eighty
days long, while the reverse seasons in each
hemisphere are only three hundred and six
days long. The northern summer is not<span class="pagenum" title="172"><a name="Page_172" id="Page_172"></a></span>
only longer but also cooler than the southern,
and the northern winter is shorter and warmer
than the southern. Which hemisphere has
the more favorable climate depends upon
what is needed on Mars to maintain life. It
may be that in this regard the shorter, hotter,
southern summer is the best season the
planet affords.</p>


<h3>SURFACE ASPECTS OF MARS</h3>

<p>Seen through a telescope, Mars is not so
red as it appears to the naked eye. One of
the best observers of it has compared it to
an opal, and it surely has some of the qualities
of an opal in the diversity of aspect that
it shows to different observers from different
points of view. No other planet has been so
subjected to controversy over what appears
on its surface. This is partly due to its being
the only planet whose surface is without
doubt open to our view and in a situation
where it can be minutely studied, and partly
to the fact that the controversy involves
questions concerning life and intelligence,
which are always of intense human interest.
Matters of this vital sort are never accepted
without dispute. That is one way of getting<span class="pagenum" title="173"><a name="Page_173" id="Page_173"></a></span>
at the truth. In the intensity of the discussion
the question of the existence of the
phenomena and that of the meaning ascribed
to them are sometimes unnecessarily made
to depend upon each other. In the case of
Mars it may well be that there is less difference
of opinion as to what is really seen on
its surface than as to the meaning of the
phenomena.</p>

<p>There are recorded observations made of
Mars as early as 272 <span class="lowercase smcap">B.C.</span>, more than two
thousand years ago, and it has been nearly
two hundred and fifty years since the snow-caps
were first seen. Through the telescope
not only the snow-caps are plainly visible at
the proper seasons, but there are also visible
dark patches over the surface, showing a
variety of color, and in certain parts changing
somewhat as the seasons change. It is one
of these patches, the outline of which suggests
a somewhat twisted eye, that is known
as the “eye of Mars.” The main surface
of the planet is reddish yellow in color;
the patches on it are variously described as
gray, grayish green, or blue, colors which in
combination could easily take on a tone of
any of them according to the eye of the observer,
and this portion of the planet’s sur<span class="pagenum" title="174"><a name="Page_174" id="Page_174"></a></span>face
does, in fact, show first one and then
the other of them predominating.</p>

<p>When the planet’s differences of color were
first observed, the reddish-yellow portion
was supposed to be land, and the areas of
varying bluish-green and gray were thought
to be the waters of the ever-changing seas.
A little after the middle of the last century
some keen eyes saw a few streaks or markings
of some sort across the land areas, and
in 1877 a close study of the planet by an
eminent Italian astronomer, Schiaparelli,
brought to his view many greenish streaks,
all directed toward the so-called seas, and
sometimes seeming to intersect there. In
publishing this discovery Schiaparelli called
these streaks <i>canalli</i>, which is properly translated
“channels,” but appeared in English as
“canals.” Since “canal” with us means artificially
constructed waterways, the discovery
became at once one of universal interest; for
artificial waterways mean human beings to
construct them, and it was an intensely interesting
thing to know that Mars was probably
inhabited with beings at least somewhat
after our own kind. It was a new world.
The little planet became a topic of absorbing
interest to all of us. And thus began the<span class="pagenum" title="175"><a name="Page_175" id="Page_175"></a></span>
controversy over the habitability of Mars,
and the meaning of its surface features, in
which astronomers, seeking only for the
truth, have taken a much more dignified
part than they have sometimes been more or
less sensationally represented as doing. The
discoverer of the so-called canals himself
believed them to be natural waterways cutting
through the land after the manner of
our straits and channels, and had very little
to say in explanation of them. But his work
gave a new impetus to the study of this little
brother world of ours.</p>

<p>In our own country the observatory at
Flagstaff is the one the best known among
those doing research work on Mars; but it is
not the only one. The observatory there is
finely situated in the thin, clear atmosphere
of Arizona, the mechanical facilities for such
work are good, and there seems no doubt that
there are there some observers who have
eyes that were made for seeing. All that
the sharp vision of Schiaparelli saw has
been seen there, and much more. Several
hundred canals have been discovered, and
at certain seasons many of them have
appeared to become double. Their courses
have been followed, and their appearances<span class="pagenum" title="176"><a name="Page_176" id="Page_176"></a></span>
and disappearances have been watched.
Somewhere near six hundred of them have
been mapped. According to these maps,
the canals seem to be laid out with a geometrical
precision such as nature is not
likely to follow; they run across some regions
that were formerly supposed to be water,
and they have points of convergence every
here and there, forming at such points large
dark areas.</p>

<p>Naturally, when a person has discovered
any new and curious phenomenon in nature
he seeks to determine the exact meaning of
it. It would have very little interest for
him if he did not, and it would be a dry lot
of facts that did not arouse a desire to do
this. The interpretation put upon what has
been seen at the observatory at Flagstaff is, in
brief, about as follows:</p>

<p>The surface of Mars has no oceans or
mountains. The reddish areas, which form
the larger part of the surface, are deserts.
The blue-green streaks are ribbons of vegetation
along each side of artificially constructed
waterways, which are of immense
length and cross and recross each other
until they somewhat resemble a network of
lines over the desert surface of the planet,<span class="pagenum" title="177"><a name="Page_177" id="Page_177"></a></span>
and are used for irrigating this arid region.
The points where the canals converge and
form the large dark spots are oases made
by the water carried by the canals. The
water is supplied by the melting of the caps
of snow at the poles during the Martian
summer, the expanding of the lines of vegetation
seeming to occur at periods corresponding
to the time required for the water
of the melting snow to reach the oases.
The presence of this vast system of artificial
waterways covering a large part of the surface
of Mars makes it seem probable that
“Mars is inhabited by beings of some sort
or other,” that these beings are not men
such as we know anything about, but that
“there may be a local intelligence equal to
or superior to ours.”</p>

<p>These conclusions concerning what is seen
on Mars are not held by any one to be completely
proved, but are thought by their author
to follow reasonably from the phenomena
as observed. By persons of a different
temperament they are regarded as too complete
an explanation, particularly as the
data upon which they are founded are not
undisputed. Some of the best astronomers
have not been able even to see the multitude<span class="pagenum" title="178"><a name="Page_178" id="Page_178"></a></span>
of fine lines, much less to give any explanation
of them. Others do not regard it as
certain that they are so geometric in their
outlines as to suggest anything more than
cracks or clefts in the surface of Mars, such
as might be made by nature, and consider
that, instead of indicating life, human or
other, they may be the marks of age, such
as similar lines or cracks which have been
observed on Mercury seem to be.</p>

<p>Also, it is not at all certain that there is
sufficient water vapor in the slight atmosphere
of Mars to furnish the snow necessary
for this great irrigating system, nor the heat
to melt it at the proper season. The natural
temperature of Mars would be, as we have
seen, very low, and unless it is modified in
some way not yet indicated everything points
to a frigidity too intense to permit the continuance
of life and growth of any sort
known to us.</p>

<p>These things must all be reckoned with
before anything certain can be known of the
surface of Mars. The difficulty of pronouncing
upon the minute details is impressively
indicated by Professor Moulton, who
says that, even under the finest conditions
and with the best telescopes, it is like view<span class="pagenum" title="179"><a name="Page_179" id="Page_179"></a></span>ing
“a perfectly accurate relief map of the
whole United States made on such a scale
that it would be only three inches in diameter
and held at a distance of three feet
from the eye.” Under such a near limit of
vision, we can well see that differences of
opinion might arise.</p>

<p>The mere fact that some astronomers have
not seen the lines on Mars does not mean
that they deny their existence. Some eyes
have greater defining power than others, as
well as some telescopes, as every one knows.
But while all the lines and patches of color
that are claimed to have been seen on Mars
doubtless have been seen by some persons,
yet it is not necessary to accept the interpretation
of them given by lively-minded
observers when it is not convincing. There
may be vegetation on Mars, and even intelligent
beings. We do not know; and thus far
there is not much to support, even by inference,
the view that there are. If we want
the truth, we are brought no nearer to it by
giving full credence to a speculative theory
simply because it is interesting and pleasant;
and thus far all theories advanced as to
the nature of the surface markings on Mars
are speculations, though there is no doubt that<span class="pagenum" title="180"><a name="Page_180" id="Page_180"></a></span>
the marks are there. It is pleasing, however,
to contemplate the idea of there being
on Mars, or on any other planet, an active
intelligence of any sort resembling what we
have here on earth, and it is not strange that
such a wide-spread popular interest should
attach to Mars, in view of what has been
suggested by the markings on its surface.</p>


<h3>THE SATELLITES OF MARS</h3>

<p>Mars has a little family of two moons.
Tiny little bodies they are, the smallest in
the solar family except, perhaps, an occasional
asteroid. Neither one of them is more
than ten miles in diameter, and the two together
are smaller than any other known
satellite. They can only be seen when Mars
is in opposition, and then only with a fairly
large telescope. They were discovered in
1877, and named Phobos and Deimos, the
names of the two attendants of the god of
war. Phobos is the brighter and the nearer
to the planet. It is less than four thousand
miles from the surface of Mars; and on account
of its being so near and the shape of
Mars being a spheroid, like that of the earth,
the little satellite can never be seen from<span class="pagenum" title="181"><a name="Page_181" id="Page_181"></a></span>
Mars beyond sixty-nine degrees of latitude
on each side of the equator. Within these
limits it shows great activity. It makes a
complete circuit around Mars in seven and
a half hours; and this swift revolution, combined
with the motion of Mars on its axis,
makes Phobos seem to rise in the west and
set in the east, pass over the heavens in less
than twelve hours, and go through all its
phases, from “new” to “full,” one and a
half times every night. Its light is rather
insignificant, being about sixty times less
than we receive from our satellite; but, on
the whole, it must be a rather gay and pleasant
little moon.</p>

<p>Deimos is not any larger than Phobos,
and not as bright; but it is slightly less difficult
for us to see, because it is between two
and three times farther away from Mars
than Phobos is, and thus not so much lost
in the light of the planet. It circles around
Mars in a little more than thirty hours, and
this, being only six hours more than Mars
consumes in turning around on its axis, results
in requiring more than two days for
the satellite to pass from rising to setting.
Between rising and setting it goes through
its phases four times. It can be seen from<span class="pagenum" title="182"><a name="Page_182" id="Page_182"></a></span>
all parts of Mars, but gives very little light
to the planet&mdash;more than a thousand times
less than our moon gives us.</p>

<p>The symbol of Mars is ♂, a conventionalized
figure representing a shield and a spear&mdash;implements
of war appropriate for the use
of the deity especially connected with warfare.</p>

<h2>XIII</h2>

<h3>JUPITER</h3>


<p>One never feels so impressed with the
power of the sun as when one contemplates
it in relation to Jupiter. Great
Jupiter, he may well be called, nearly five
hundred million miles out in space, almost
a sun himself, the center of a system containing
bodies larger than the sun’s nearest
planet, Mercury; and yet just Jupiter,
one of the planets, held firmly in leash
like the others by the sun’s overwhelming
force of gravity, forever compelled to revolve
about that parent body with the rest of its
offspring, to stay at home within the bounds
of the sun’s domain, to keep within certain
limits in his own orbit, forced to hasten on
when he comes nearest the power that controls
him, and unable to keep up the same
rate of speed when he is farther away. One
may well wonder at the immensity beyond
comprehension of the stars, among which<span class="pagenum" title="184"><a name="Page_184" id="Page_184"></a></span>
our sun is but a very small one, when one
considers how even this small one can thus
swing huge Jupiter about. For Jupiter is,
after the sun itself, the mammoth member
of our system. In volume he is larger than
all the other planets put together, and in
mass he is more than double as large as the
combined mass of all the others. He is about
equal to the sun in density, and about one-fourth
as dense as the earth.</p>

<p>There is less difference in size between
Jupiter and the sun than there is between
Jupiter and the earth. His diameter is
eleven times greater than that of the earth.
The sun’s diameter is only ten times greater
than Jupiter’s. His surface is one hundred
and sixteen times that of the earth; the sun’s
own surface is only a hundred times larger
than his. Jupiter weighs more than three
hundred times as much as the earth; the
sun weighs only six times more than Jupiter.
At the equator his diameter is about ninety
thousand miles; but, as the planet is much
flattened at the poles, the diameter from
pole to pole is only a little more than eighty-four
thousand miles. This flattening is due
to the very rapid spinning of the planet on
its axis, a motion that will always cause a<span class="pagenum" title="185"><a name="Page_185" id="Page_185"></a></span>
plastic body to bulge at the equator, and
thus flatten at the poles.</p>

<div><p class="tac">JUPITER, THE MAMMOTH MEMBER OF THE SOLAR FAMILY&mdash;LARGER
THAN ALL THE OTHER PLANETS PUT TOGETHER</p>

<p>This photograph shows the flattening at the poles and also the belts
encircling the planet. It was photographed at the Yerkes Observatory.</p></div>
</div>

<p>The force of gravity on Jupiter is about
two and one-half times greater than on the
earth. A fairy-like figure weighing here only
a hundred pounds would be held to the surface
of Jupiter with a force equal to two
hundred and sixty pounds. This tremendous
power makes Jupiter the greatest disturbing
body among all the planets. He gives
Saturn a mighty pull when the two planets
come near each other; he draws some of
the little asteroids five or six degrees out of
their course when it carries them into the
field of his influence; and there are as many
as thirty comets that have become permanent
members of the solar system, because
through his great power of attraction he has
made them captive.</p>

<p>Jupiter is so much farther from the sun
than we are that his orbit is about five times
larger than that of the earth. In consequence
also of his greater distance from the
sun, he moves much more slowly than the
earth. His average velocity is about eight
miles a second. It requires more than four
thousand days, or nearly twelve of our years,
for him to make one revolution around the<span class="pagenum" title="186"><a name="Page_186" id="Page_186"></a></span>
sun, and he thus consumes more than ten
thousand of his own days. He travels
through about one sign of the zodiac each
year, and is thus not very difficult to keep
trace of, since the signs and the constellations
of the zodiac so nearly coincide. His
synodic period, or the period from one opposition
to another, is a fraction less than
three hundred and ninety-nine days, or about
one year and a little more than a month.
His daily motion in the skies is almost too
small for us to detect it without observation
for more than a day. It is in one day about
equal to one-sixth of the apparent diameter
of the moon; but in a month he has moved
a distance about half as great as that between
the two pointers in the Big Dipper,
as can be easily seen by comparison with the
stars near him.</p>


<h3>JUPITER’S PLACE IN THE SKY</h3>

<p>Jupiter is now (1912) in the constellation
Scorpio, and he will be in this region, and
thus a summer star, for several years to
come. In 1913 he will be in opposition
early in July, and will then be in Sagittarius,
not far from the little “milk dipper,” and<span class="pagenum" title="187"><a name="Page_187" id="Page_187"></a></span>
will be a gloriously beautiful object during all
the summer. He will be in opposition about
August 10, 1914, in Capricornus, and will
again be the most brilliant object in the
summer sky. In 1915 he will be in opposition
a little after the middle of September,
and will then be situated on or near the
eastern edge of Aquarius, where he will be
a very distinguished star during all the
charming evenings of late summer and the
autumn. He always seems particularly splendid
when in this season of the year he
reaches opposition. The insistent brilliancy
of his disc brings him then into view before
the sun is fairly down; and he hangs, placid
and alone, in the southeastern sky during
the autumn twilight, and later in the evening
shows to advantage his dominating
beauty, with Antares on the west of him and
Fomalhaut below him, no less charming in
their own way, but far less brilliant than
this splendid planet.</p>

<p>In 1916, when opposition will occur not
far from Hallowe’en, Jupiter will be about
on the eastern border of the constellation
Pisces, and, rising then just as the sun sets,
will enliven the evening view for the rest
of that year. He will appear at his very<span class="pagenum" title="188"><a name="Page_188" id="Page_188"></a></span>
best at this time, for he will be at about his
nearest to the sun; and all that this situation
can do for him in the way of enhancing his
brilliancy may then be seen.</p>

<p>In 1917 he will be in opposition to the sun
about the first of December, in Taurus; and for
the next few years he will be a winter star, moving
majestically along his path in the zodiac,
never more than one and a half degrees from
the ecliptic, and passing in turn the Pleiades,
Aldebaran, Castor and Pollux, and the little
Bee-hive in Cancer. There will be no
opposition in 1918; but one will occur early
in January, 1919, when Jupiter is in the
eastern half of Gemini; and toward the middle
of February, 1920, another will take
place, when the planet is in Cancer, with
Castor and Pollux, the sparkling twin stars
in Gemini, to the west of him.</p>

<p>During part of 1920 and all of the next
three years Jupiter will be journeying across
Leo, Virgo, Libra, and Scorpio. He will be
opposite the sun in 1921, a little after the
middle of March; in 1922, in the latter half
of April; and in 1923, toward the very last
of May. He will pass near Regulus, the
sparkling star in the handle of the Sickle,
in the summer of 1920; near Spica in 1921;<span class="pagenum" title="189"><a name="Page_189" id="Page_189"></a></span>
and he will not be far from Antares in
1923.</p>

<p>In 1924 Jupiter’s cycle of twelve years
will be completed, and he will be in opposition
again early in July, and situated near
the western edge of Sagittarius, not far from
where he was in 1912.</p>

<p>These cycles do not repeat themselves
exactly; but the planet lacks only four days
of having been in opposition eleven times
during twelve of our years, so that it is not
difficult to keep track of him through a long
series of years. For exact dates, such as
one needs in a very close study of the planet,
an almanac must be consulted; but this is
not necessary for mere recognition, which
is all that is needed to enjoy the acquaintance
of great Jupiter.</p>

<p>Every year Jupiter is an evening star for
more than six months. For two months
before opposition he rises somewhat after
sundown; at opposition he appears exactly
at the setting of the sun; and thereafter he
is found in the evening sky, appearing farther
toward the west each evening, until,
when nearing conjunction, he is lost to our
view for a time. He is a morning star for
an equal length of time, and for about three<span class="pagenum" title="190"><a name="Page_190" id="Page_190"></a></span>
months can be seen between midnight and
six in the morning; but much of the rest
of the time he is obscured by the daylight.</p>

<p>Jupiter retrogrades in his motion for about
two months before and after each opposition;
but, since he changes his place to the extent
of only two and a half degrees a month,
the whole apparently backward movement
amounts only to ten degrees a year. Still, it
is very interesting to watch him swing back
and forth over this ten degrees before he
starts out on each yearly journey.</p>


<h3>DISTANCE, LIGHT, AND HEAT</h3>

<p>Jupiter is nearly five times farther from
the sun than we are. His mean distance
from that orb is four hundred and eighty-three
millions of miles. His orbit is not so
eccentric as that of Mercury or of Mars,
but the eccentricity is sufficient to make his
distance vary by as much as forty-two
millions of miles. His distance is five hundred
and four millions of miles when he is
farthest from the sun, and four hundred and
sixty-two millions when he is nearest to it.
On account of his orbit being outside of<span class="pagenum" title="191"><a name="Page_191" id="Page_191"></a></span>
ours, we are at times nearer to him and at
others farther from him than the sun ever
is. At his best situation when in opposition,
we are three hundred and sixty-nine million
miles from him. This is more than ten
times farther than we are from Mars at that
planet’s most favorable oppositions, and yet
Jupiter is much brighter at such times than
Mars ever appears to be. At the times of
conjunction he is five hundred and ninety-six
millions of miles from us, but is still
always brighter than a first-magnitude star
like Capella or Vega.</p>

<p>Although the distance of Jupiter from us
varies thus two hundred and twenty-seven
million miles, there is never in him the
marked difference in brilliancy that we see
in Mars. He is at all times so far away that
the variation in distance does not count for
as much, though we can see the effect of it
plainly enough, even with the naked eye.
Light, with all its marvelous speed, consumes
more than fifty-three minutes in its journey
from Jupiter to the earth when we are most
widely separated from him. When we are
nearest to him light comes to us from the
planet in twenty minutes less time. At his
average distance from the sun it requires<span class="pagenum" title="192"><a name="Page_192" id="Page_192"></a></span>
about forty-three minutes for light to pass
from the sun to Jupiter.</p>

<p>Notwithstanding the sun’s great power
over Jupiter in shaping his course, it does
not give him much in return for his subserviency.
So far as light and brilliancy are
concerned, it is to Jupiter a very small sun
indeed. To an observer on Jupiter the sun
would not appear to be more than one-fifth
as large as it seems to us. The light it furnishes
to Jupiter is twenty-five times less than
we receive; and if the planet depended entirely
upon the sun for heat, his temperature
would be more than two hundred degrees
below zero, Fahrenheit. There is every
reason to believe that the little heat the sun
gives to this mighty planet does not count
for much one way or the other at the planet’s
present stage of development. Jupiter does
not need the nourishing that the smaller
terrestrial planets must have, or die. He is
probably almost a sun himself. We are not
at all certain that the planet is even so far
cooled as to have a solid surface. If it has,
there is reason to think that the surface is
at least red hot, and gives to the planet a
temperature higher than anything we have
any comprehension of. Jupiter’s atmos<span class="pagenum" title="193"><a name="Page_193" id="Page_193"></a></span>phere,
too, is extremely thick and dense, so
that the planet is probably so protected that
it gets very little heat from the sun and
loses very little of its own.</p>

<p>It is certain, however, that this great
planet is not so much of a sun as to shine
by its own light. The light we receive,
though it is very brilliant, is reflected sunlight.
This is shown by the fact that the
planet does not furnish light for its own
satellites. When they pass into its shadow
the sunlight is shut off from them; and if
they receive any light from Jupiter, it is too
dusky to be perceptible to us. That the
planet may have a red glow, though, is
also suggested by the action of the satellites.
When they pass between us and Jupiter
they sometimes cast less of a shadow on his
surface than would be expected, thus indicating
that the surface is not altogether
dark, though it may only dully glow rather
than shine.</p>


<h3>DAY AND NIGHT, SEASONS, AND ATMOSPHERE</h3>

<p>Jupiter accomplishes one rotation in a
little less than ten hours; but, curiously
enough, all parts of the planet do not rotate<span class="pagenum" title="194"><a name="Page_194" id="Page_194"></a></span>
in the same length of time. A day at the
equator is nine hours and fifty minutes in
length. In some of the higher latitudes it
is nine hours and fifty-five minutes, and
this notwithstanding the equator is so much
larger in circumference than any other part
and any one point on it has farther to go in
a revolution. As many as eight different
rates of rotation have been observed; and
even in the same zones some parts seem to
lag behind others, taking a little more time
to complete the rotation than other parts
surrounding them. This is another indication
that Jupiter is not a solid body. The
surface features are none of them permanent,
though some of them remain practically the
same for years. It is through this occasional
stability of them that it has been
possible to mark the planet’s time of rotation.</p>

<p>In the matter of seasons Jupiter has very
little variety. The axis of the planet is inclined
but little more than three degrees to
its orbit, so that whatever amount of heat
the sun’s radiance affords must be very nearly
uniform during the entire Jovian year. Its
distance, too, is at all times so great that
there would be no appreciable change in tem<span class="pagenum" title="195"><a name="Page_195" id="Page_195"></a></span>perature
between its perihelion and aphelion
positions.</p>

<p>There is every indication that Jupiter has
an extraordinarily dense and deep atmosphere.
It has been sometimes estimated to
be as much as a thousand miles in depth,
and the spectroscope shows it to be heavily
laden with vapor. But beyond these very
general facts not much is definitely known
about it. It is certain, though, that it is
very different from our atmosphere. The
spectroscope shows in it elements, or compounds
of elements, which are not familiar
to us. The enormous gravitative power of
Jupiter would enable him to hold gases
rarer than the earth, or the smaller planets
like the earth, ever acquired. A molecule of
gas would have to move more rapidly than
thirty-seven miles a second to escape from
Jupiter. The earth, as we have seen, cannot
hold any gases moving faster than seven
miles a second. So there are many gases which
may forever remain in Jupiter’s atmosphere
and yet have never had a place in ours.</p>


<h3>SURFACE FEATURES</h3>

<p>Seen through a telescope, Jupiter shows
the loveliest variety of colors, with the red<span class="pagenum" title="196"><a name="Page_196" id="Page_196"></a></span>dish
ones always most conspicuous. The
slightly pink-tinted steady light that we get
from the planet with the naked eye in no
way suggests the turbulent, flame-like aspect
that a telescopic view opens to us. The
telescope also reveals very clearly that flattening
at the poles which has already been
spoken of.</p>

<p>With so dense an atmosphere as Jupiter
most likely has, it is sometimes doubtful
whether his surface can be seen by us at
all. But it is certain that we see something
apparently much more dense and stable
than an atmosphere is supposed to be; and
hence it is thought that, in spite of its thickness,
the atmosphere may be only partially
opaque, and that it may be in some places
even more or less transparent.</p>

<p>It does not seem probable that the markings
on Jupiter are wholly atmospheric.
Some of them indicate that the substance
we see has considerably more consistency
than a mere gas. The whole surface of the
planet is covered with belts and spots of
various colors and varying shapes. The
belted appearance is particularly marked.
It has been noticed for more than two hundred
years, and can be seen with a com<span class="pagenum" title="197"><a name="Page_197" id="Page_197"></a></span>paratively
small telescope. Sometimes as
many as twenty or thirty belts have been
seen at one time. All of them are parallel
with the equator.</p>

<p>Two broad red belts on each side of the
equator, called the tropical belts, are very
distinct, and sometimes retain the same
shape and color for months at a time, though
sometimes they change rapidly in both color
and outline. Between them is the equatorial
belt, which is also a semi-permanent
feature, remaining often for a considerable
period unchanged. These belts, and the
spots that sometimes appear on and near
them, have been closely watched, because
about the equator, and especially just south
of it, is the region of greatest activity on
Jupiter’s surface.</p>

<p>One feature that more nearly suggests
solidity and permanency than anything else
on Jupiter is the famous great red spot
which lies in the southern hemisphere just
below the southern tropical belt. It appeared
about thirty-five years ago, in July,
1878, as a pale pink spot, grew brighter for
two or three years, and then faded, until,
at the end of two or three more years, it
was almost invisible. In another year it<span class="pagenum" title="198"><a name="Page_198" id="Page_198"></a></span>
came again, and increased in brightness for
five or six years. Then it grew a little fainter,
and has since remained a rather faint red
spot, but plainly visible.</p>

<p>In shape the great red spot is an immense
oval as much as thirty thousand miles from
east to west and seven thousand miles from
north to south, which gives it a surface four
or five times as large as the land area on
the entire earth, and larger even than the
whole surface of the earth including the
oceans. Although retaining its own shape,
it seems to drift about among its surroundings,
showing that it is not attached to any
solid surface; and yet it has a suggestion of
solidity in itself, which was shown when it
and another smaller spot were seen to be
drifting toward each other, and then finally
to meet. Instead of colliding or going over
or under, they calmly drifted to one side and
went around each other.</p>

<p>Appearances such as this have suggested
the idea that the great spot might be a continent
in process of formation. Such an
idea is at best a speculation; but it would
be interesting if it should prove that we are
witnessing on Jupiter the process through
which our own earth must at one time have<span class="pagenum" title="199"><a name="Page_199" id="Page_199"></a></span>
passed when its crust began to solidify in
patches, as one of the steps in the long period
of evolution which has prepared it for our
uses. It is not at all certain that Jupiter
will ever be just like the earth. The differences
between its atmosphere and ours may
have some influence in its development that
we have little knowledge of at present, and
there are some other fundamental differences
between the two planets which may in some
way effect a difference in development. But
in a general way we know that the planet
will in time become more condensed than it
now is and will finally solidify. Whether
the processes will be carried on in just the
same way in which they have been here on
the earth is not so certain.</p>


<h3>JUPITER’S SYSTEM OF SATELLITES</h3>

<p>Jupiter is the center of a superb system of
satellites, eight in number. Four of them
were first seen in 1610, and have the honor
to be the first heavenly bodies discovered by
means of the telescope. The fifth one was not
discovered until 1892. The sixth was first seen
in 1904, and the seventh in 1905. After three
years an eighth was discovered (in 1908).</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" title="200"><a name="Page_200" id="Page_200"></a></span></p>

<p>When the first four satellites were discovered
they were named respectively, in
the order of their distances from Jupiter,
Io, Europa, Ganymede, and Callisto. Ganymede
is not only the largest of the four, but
is also the largest satellite in the solar system.
It is larger than Mercury, and not
much smaller than Mars. Callisto is next
to Ganymede in size, and is about the size
of Mercury. Io is about the size of our
moon, and Europa is not much smaller.
Under very favorable conditions Ganymede
and Callisto can be seen by the naked eye;
but a good many persons think they see the
moons of Jupiter when they see only some
small stars in that region. They are invisible
to most people, but probably could
be seen oftener if it were not for the glaring
light of the planet, which more or less obscures
anything so near it.</p>

<p>After the discovery of Jupiter’s fifth
satellite, astronomers seem to have become
possessed with that dull spirit of orderliness
such as is sometimes exhibited by city
councils in substituting numbers for historic
and beautiful names in designating streets.
No more of Jupiter’s satellites were given
names such as might be appropriate for<span class="pagenum" title="201"><a name="Page_201" id="Page_201"></a></span>
members of this Jovian family; but all were
given numbers&mdash;the first four in order of
their distance from Jupiter, the others in
order of their discovery. Io, Europa, Ganymede,
and Callisto are now designated, respectively,
I, II, III, and IV, while V, VI,
VII, and VIII have never had any designation
other than these numbers.</p>

<p>The fifth satellite, discovered in 1892, is
the nearest to Jupiter, and the smallest of
all his satellites. Its diameter is probably
not more than one hundred and twenty
miles, but its exact size can be estimated
only by the amount of light it reflects. It
is too small to show a measurable disc, and
cannot even be seen when it makes a transit
across the planet. It would seem then a mere
speck, if we could see it at all. It makes one
revolution about Jupiter in less than twelve
hours (eleven hours and fifty-seven minutes),
and is only a little more than twenty-two
thousand miles from the surface of the planet
at the equator. It appears to us as a star
of about the thirteenth magnitude, and cannot
be seen except with a large telescope.
Owing to the great curvature of the planet,
and to the satellite’s being so near him, it
cannot be seen from the surface of Jupiter<span class="pagenum" title="202"><a name="Page_202" id="Page_202"></a></span>
beyond sixty-five degrees of latitude. It
moves faster than any other satellite in the
solar system, going at the rate of sixteen and
a half miles a second. It does not make a
revolution in as short a time as Phobos, the
little satellite of Mars, does, but it has a
much longer distance to travel and goes at
a faster rate. The fact that Jupiter rotates
in ten hours and the satellite makes a revolution
around him in twelve hours results
in the satellite’s taking five of Jupiter’s days
to cross from the eastern horizon to the
western. It would go through all its phases
four times during that period if it were not
that, being so near the planet, his huge form
cuts off the sunlight from the little satellite
for nearly one-fifth of the time, and it is
never seen “full.”</p>

<p>This satellite is very difficult for us to see
on account of its diminutive size and its
nearness to the shining disc of Jupiter; yet
it was discovered by means of the telescope,
and not by photography, as so many small
bodies are discovered nowadays, and by a
man who thus far has not been able to see
the fine line markings on Mars, which some
other astronomers think they can see&mdash;a
fact that is very interesting as showing the<span class="pagenum" title="203"><a name="Page_203" id="Page_203"></a></span>
difference between observers even of great
keenness of vision. From this satellite Jupiter
would seem an enormous body, nearly
eighty-five times larger than our sun appears
to us, and, no doubt, a splendid object.
But the little satellite pays rather dearly for
the view by suffering numerous and long-continued
eclipses.</p>

<p>The sixth and seventh satellites are also
very minute bodies, measuring probably less
than one hundred miles in diameter. They
circle about Jupiter at a distance nearly
thirty times more remote than our moon
is from us. They are about seven million
miles from the planet, and probably not
more than barely visible from it. It takes
them two hundred and sixty-five days to
make one revolution, which is more than
five hundred times as long as the period of
Jupiter’s nearest satellite. These two satellites
are so nearly of one size and revolve
so nearly in the same time and at the same
distance from Jupiter that they are thought
to have had a common origin. Just what
their relation is has not yet been determined.</p>

<p>The eighth satellite, discovered in January,
1908, is certainly no larger, and is perhaps
still more tiny, than the sixth and the seventh,<span class="pagenum" title="204"><a name="Page_204" id="Page_204"></a></span>
though it is a little brighter than either one
of them. It is about three times farther
away from Jupiter than the seventh satellite,
and with eyes such as ours would not be
visible from Jupiter. It shows to us as about
a seventeenth-magnitude star, which is almost
at the limit of our vision with even
the largest telescope. It seems to revolve
about Jupiter in a direction exactly opposite
to that of the other satellites&mdash;a retrograde
motion that appears in the solar system in
only two or three other cases and has not
yet been entirely accounted for.</p>

<p>Jupiter’s satellites have played an important
part in astronomical discoveries
and investigations. It was through observation
of their transits that it was discovered
that light occupied time in passing through
space. When Jupiter was near us in his
orbit, the eclipses occurred too soon for their
calculated time; when he was farther away,
they occurred too late. It was found that
these irregularities were due to the fact that
light is not transmitted through space instantaneously,
and further investigation
showed that it travels at the rate of 186,400
miles a second. The eclipses of Jupiter’s
moons are carefully computed and recorded<span class="pagenum" title="205"><a name="Page_205" id="Page_205"></a></span>
in the <i>Nautical Almanac</i>, and it is through
observations of them that chronometers are
corrected at sea.</p>

<p>Ganymede and Callisto have been found
to keep always the same face toward the
planet, as our moon keeps always the same
face toward us; and it is thought that all of
Jupiter’s satellites probably do this.</p>

<p>The symbol of Jupiter is ♃, a hieroglyph
for the eagle, which was the bird of Jove.</p>

<h2>XIV</h2>

<h3>SATURN</h3>


<p>Among the four planets that we commonly
see, the easiest, perhaps, to keep
track of is Saturn. Its peculiar aspect is
very distinctly marked. It appears as a
large, pale, yellow star shining with a soft,
misty light that sometimes barely escapes
being dull. It is always as bright as a first-magnitude
star, but not always as bright
as Sirius, and never as brilliant as Mars,
Jupiter, or Venus when they are at their
brightest. The general effect of it is as a
large rather than a brilliant star.</p>

<p>The only time it loses these very marked
characteristics is when it is drawing in toward
the sun, and thus nearing conjunction.
At such times we see it each evening lower
in the rosy glow of the setting sun, and more
and more obscured and changed in color by
the surrounding atmosphere. Then it sometimes
seems as red as Mercury, and some<span class="pagenum" title="207"><a name="Page_207" id="Page_207"></a></span>times
even twinkles a little in a sort of farewell
gaiety as it backs away from us into
the rays of the dazzling sun and finally disappears
for a time from the evening sky.
Proximity to the sun and entanglement in
the atmosphere of the horizon has this effect
more or less on all the planets, as we know,
but it always seems unexpected in Saturn,
because it is so out of keeping with his
ordinarily large, pale, placid face, which suggests
softness and gentleness rather than
vivacity.</p>

<p>But there is no mistaking the planet even
under this aspect if we but stop to think where
he is. And it is through knowing where he
is that it is so easy to keep track of Saturn.
For nearly two years and a half, on an average,
he remains in the same constellation,
passing slowly over about one degree a
month, or a little more than twelve degrees
in a year, occupying almost thirty years in
making one circuit through the constellations
of the zodiac. One has, therefore, ample
time to get well acquainted with him before
he has wandered far from the position in
which one first found him.</p>

<p>For nearly six months each year Saturn
shines as an evening star, and, returning each<span class="pagenum" title="208"><a name="Page_208" id="Page_208"></a></span>
year as he does with such slight changes of
position, he comes to have something of the
stability of a fixed star. Having seen him
one year, we can count on his returning the
next only about thirteen days behind time,
and but little farther from his original position
than twice the distance between the
pointers in the Big Dipper.</p>

<p>The one degree a month which he travels
along the ecliptic is toward the east, except
for a little more than two months before
opposition, and the same length of time
afterward, when he has the slight apparent
retrograde motion due to our overtaking and
passing him, which has been explained. With
Saturn this motion is so slight&mdash;only four
degrees&mdash;that it does not put him much out
of position, and it is, in fact, not much noticed
except by close observers. He has all the time
been going steadily on toward the east (for
the retrograde motion is only an apparent
motion), and the annual change of twelve degrees
in position is always in this direction.</p>

<p>My first acquaintance with Saturn was
when he was traveling through Pisces and
Aries, where there are no first-magnitude
stars to mark the path of the wandering
bodies in the heavens. It was then that I<span class="pagenum" title="209"><a name="Page_209" id="Page_209"></a></span>
was most impressed with the fixity and
reliability of his return. Every autumn then
for five years we watched Antares passing
toward the west, followed by the little “milk
dipper” in Sagittarius; and then Fomalhaut,
crossing the sky in the same direction, though
below the constellations of the zodiac; and
then turned our eyes toward the east, knowing
that the next bright body to come peeping
over the tops of the trees would be Saturn.
And when the first frosts began to strip the
leaves from the trees we found the compensation
that nature always gives when she
destroys one beauty: we could see earlier
in the evening, through the bare branches,
that lovely yellowish disc, with its suggestion
of aloofness and grandeur that is peculiar to
it. For the face of Saturn, while never what
we would call cold, has little in it of that
bright, warm, friendly aspect which is at times
so characteristic of Venus, Mars, and Jupiter.</p>


<h3>AROUND ONE CIRCUIT OF THE SKIES WITH
SATURN</h3>

<p>Saturn is now (the autumn of 1912) in the
first part of his path through Taurus, and he
will be in that constellation during all of
1913 and the greater part of 1914.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" title="210"><a name="Page_210" id="Page_210"></a></span></p>

<p>From 1912 to 1920 he will be a beautiful
object in the winter sky, threading his way
slowly through that splendid galaxy of stars
that blazes across the glittering sky peculiar
to the cold winter nights. He will pass between
the Pleiades and Aldebaran, and will
be in opposition in that region on November
23, 1912. Farther east in the constellation
he will be in opposition in the first week of
December, 1913. Almost on the border line
between Taurus and Gemini he will be in
opposition during the third week in December,
1914; and, as this is very near the perihelion
point in Saturn’s orbit, the planet will
then be at his brightest.</p>

<p>In 1915 he will not be in opposition at all;
but sometime within the first two or three
days of 1916 he will reach that position, and
will then be well on in his journey across
Gemini. For these four years&mdash;from 1912
to 1916&mdash;he will be visible during the entire
night, at the times of his opposition, and in
his best condition. The rings that surround
him will then be placed so that we will get
a broad expanse of light from them, as well
as from the planet itself, which greatly increases
its brightness.</p>

<p>Saturn will then continue to move across<span class="pagenum" title="211"><a name="Page_211" id="Page_211"></a></span>
Gemini, passing in the early part of 1917
under Castor and Pollux, and very near to
Neptune&mdash;a meeting which, unfortunately,
cannot be seen with the naked eye. During
this year (1917) he will begin his journey
through the smallest of all the constellations
of the zodiac, Cancer, passing near the lovely
cluster of stars we call the Bee-hive, and will
reach Leo early in 1919, where he will remain
until about the end of 1921. While in this
region he will be visible during the winter
and all of the spring and the early summer.
All three of these constellations&mdash;Gemini,
Cancer, and Leo&mdash;while seen in the winter,
are particularly lovely in the spring. Gemini,
in the beautiful evenings of May, hangs with
its two splendid stars in the northwest above
the setting sun; and with the soft face of
Saturn near them, these stars will be more
than ever charming in the two seasons that
the planet remains with them.</p>

<p>In 1917 Saturn will be in opposition in the
region of Gemini, about the middle of January.
In 1918 opposition will occur about
the last of January, and Saturn will then be
in Cancer. The next year he will be in opposition
sometime during the second week
in February, and will then be situated be<span class="pagenum" title="212"><a name="Page_212" id="Page_212"></a></span>tween
the Bee-hive, in Cancer, and the brilliant
first-magnitude star Regulus, in Leo.
The next two oppositions will be in Leo,
about thirteen days later each year. Saturn
will then pass during the first half of 1922
into Virgo, which is the largest of all the
constellations, and he will remain there until
three oppositions have taken place, about
thirteen days later each year.</p>

<p>About a year after passing Spica, the white,
sparkling, first-magnitude star in Virgo,
Saturn will enter Libra, crossing that constellation
near the lower part of the square
in it. From there he will go through Scorpio
and Sagittarius, passing above Antares and
the “milk dipper,” and in about 1932 will have
reached that comparatively starless region
which includes a part of Sagittarius and all
of Capricornus, Aquarius, Pisces, and Aries.
For the next nine and a half years he will
give distinction to this part of the heavens,
and thus complete his circuit of twenty-nine
and a half years, and, with never resting,
never changing movement, will start on a
new round, with a new generation of eyes
following his fair face along the great circle
of the ecliptic.</p>

<p>Saturn is brightest when he is in Taurus, not<span class="pagenum" title="213"><a name="Page_213" id="Page_213"></a></span>
far from Gemini, as he will be in 1914, and
again when he is in Scorpio, as he will be
between fourteen and fifteen years later. The
recurring times at which we can get an evening
view of him at his greatest brightness thus alternate
between midwinter and midsummer.
He is least bright when he is in the last half
of Leo and when he is in that part of Aquarius
above Fomalhaut. Between these positions
he gradually waxes and wanes in brightness,
changes that are largely due to the
position of his rings.</p>


<h3>DISTANCE AND SIZE</h3>

<p>Saturn is almost twice as far from the sun
as Jupiter, and between nine and ten times
farther than we are. His mean distance
from the sun is eight hundred and eighty-seven
million miles; but his distance varies
nearly one hundred million miles between
perihelion and aphelion. His orbit is only
a trifle more eccentric than that of Jupiter,
but the variation in miles is so much greater
because the orbit is so much larger.</p>

<p>His average distance from the earth at
opposition is seven hundred and ninety-four
million miles, but at the most favorable<span class="pagenum" title="214"><a name="Page_214" id="Page_214"></a></span>
opposition it may be fifty million miles nearer
than that. At conjunction his average distance
is nine hundred and eighty million
miles; but his greatest possible distance at
such times may be as much as one billion
miles. When he is in this situation it takes
light a little more than an hour and a half
to pass from him to us. At his nearest we
receive light from him in about an hour and
six minutes. At his average distance from
the sun, light requires about an hour and
twenty minutes to go from one to the other.</p>

<p>While Saturn is next to Jupiter in size among
the planets, he is not as large as Jupiter
by two-thirds, but his mass is almost three
times greater than that of all the other planets
put together except Jupiter. It is ninety-five
times greater than that of the earth.
In diameter Saturn is 72,772 miles; but it
is more flattened at the poles than any other
planet, and in consequence there is a difference
of nearly seven thousand miles between
its polar and its equatorial diameters.</p>

<p>The density of Saturn is less than that of
any other planet, and it is ten times less
than that of the earth. No other planet is
less dense than water; but Saturn would
float in water, and is not more dense than<span class="pagenum" title="215"><a name="Page_215" id="Page_215"></a></span>
cork. On account of its mass its gravity is
greater than that of the earth by about one-tenth.
This is not enough to make a very
interesting difference in the weight of objects
on Saturn and on the earth. The average
person weighing one hundred and fifty pounds
here would weigh only one hundred and
sixty-five pounds on Saturn. The numerous
penny-in-the-slot weighing-machines vary
almost that much. Saturn has eighty-three
times more surface than the earth, and more
than seven hundred and fifty times the
earth’s volume.</p>


<h3>SURFACE ASPECTS AND CONSTITUTION</h3>

<p>It is not at all certain that Saturn, more than
Jupiter, has any solid surface. Indeed, it is almost
certain that it has not. It is surrounded
by an atmosphere of great density, and we
do not at any time see the surface of the
planet. It is believed probable that it is
at least largely in a liquid state, if not to a
great extent even gaseous.</p>

<p>The planet is certainly not in any way
dependent on the sun for the extraordinary
heat that everything indicates it to have,
and its surface is brighter than it is believed<span class="pagenum" title="216"><a name="Page_216" id="Page_216"></a></span>
it could be if shining only by the reflected
light of the sun. This does not mean that
Saturn is self-luminous; but it is nearly certain
that it is extremely hot and glowing, and
its brightness may be in part due to its own
internal fires and the extremely luminous
and dense atmosphere that surrounds it.
It receives one hundred times less heat and
light from the sun than we do. If it depended
entirely upon the sun for its heat,
the temperature would be nearly three hundred
degrees below zero, Fahrenheit. It is
probably not only very hot itself, but its
heavy atmospheric envelope perhaps allows
comparatively little heat to escape.</p>

<p>Its surface is belted and spotted somewhat
after the manner of Jupiter’s, but, being so
much farther from us than Jupiter, it does
not disclose its surface features with the same
distinctness. Apparently it is much less turbulent
than Jupiter; but even this we are
not quite certain of, and it may seem more
placid because we do not so well see its agitations.</p>

<p>Like all the outer planets, it differs in its
constitution from the earth and the other
inner planets. Its atmosphere contains compounds
with which we are not familiar, and<span class="pagenum" title="217"><a name="Page_217" id="Page_217"></a></span>
the body of the planet itself is rarer and
lighter, and less condensed, and in a much
earlier stage of evolution than the earth and
the small planets so comparatively near us.</p>


<h3>DAY AND NIGHT</h3>

<p>The length of Saturn’s day, or its period
of rotation on its axis, is about ten hours and
a quarter. Like Jupiter, it has slightly different
rates of rotation in different latitudes,
thus showing its lack of solidity. The rate
of rotation has been determined, as in the
case of Jupiter, by observation of the spots
on its surface, which, while they are not
exactly permanent, yet remain apparently
in the same positions for months and even
years at a time, and are thus sufficiently
stable to measure a rotation of so short a
time as ten hours.</p>

<p>Whirling over at this rate would cause the
sun to appear to skim across the sky very
swiftly as viewed from Saturn. In size, it
would not seem more than three times as
large as Venus at her brightest seems to
us, and every minute it would cover a distance
about equal to the diameter of the
full moon as we see it. In an hour it would<span class="pagenum" title="218"><a name="Page_218" id="Page_218"></a></span>
seem to move more than six times as far as
the distance between the “pointers.” At
the time of Saturn’s equinox the little five-hour
day, followed by the equally short night,
must present a lively aspect with the sun
racing thus swiftly across the sky in daylight
and the stars sweeping as swiftly over at
night. If things remain as they now are,
it will be a splendid panorama for the people
there when, in the far-distant future, Saturn
may have cooled and solidified sufficiently
to maintain life somewhat as we know it.
The earth, though, and Venus and Mars
would be from Saturn only telescopic objects
to eyes like ours, and Jupiter no brighter
than he is to us. Thus does our brother Saturn
pay the price of his remoteness from the
rest of the solar family.</p>


<h3>THE RINGS AND MOONS OF SATURN</h3>

<p>But the circling stars and the swift-moving
sun are the least part of the splendid spectacle
that might be seen from Saturn. He
is surrounded with no less than ten moons
of more or less imposing size, and in addition
has three rings circling around with him,
composed of myriads of small satellites, to<span class="pagenum" title="219"><a name="Page_219" id="Page_219"></a></span>gether
forming a band the outer diameter
of which is something more than twenty-one
times broader than the diameter of the
earth. These are the famous rings of Saturn,
the only objects of their kind in the solar
system, intensely interesting to scientific observers,
wonderful to the curious, and splendidly
beautiful to everybody. It is this profusion
of rings and moons that entitles
Saturn to be called, as he often has been,
the most spectacular of all the planets.</p>

<p>The outer ring is nearly ten thousand
miles broad, and is separated from the next
one by a space of about seventeen hundred
miles. The second ring is nearly eighteen
thousand miles across. It is very bright on
the outer edge, but gradually grows less so,
until, with a not very perceptible division, it
fades into the inner ring, which is but slightly
luminous, and is called the crape ring. This
is about nine thousand miles broad and nearly
ten thousand miles from Saturn. This gradual
fading of the rings to a dusky hue toward
the center, and then the blackness of the
space between them and the planet, gives
them from certain points of view a nest-like
appearance; and my first impression of
Saturn, when I saw him through the tele<span class="pagenum" title="220"><a name="Page_220" id="Page_220"></a></span>scope,
was that he was nestling in a concave
body of light&mdash;an appearance that is intensified
by his extreme flatness at the poles.</p>

<p>Notwithstanding the imposing breadth of
these rings, they are less than a hundred
miles in thickness. They are, in fact, nothing
more than an untold number of tiny
satellites revolving about Saturn in the same
plane and close enough together to appear,
at the distance they are from us, as if they
were one body. Just how close they are
together, and how they appear when near
by, we do not yet know. It was first shown
by mechanical laws that they <i>must</i> be composed
of separate bodies; the spectroscope
shows that they <i>are</i>; and it has recently been
thought that they have even been <i>seen</i> to be
so through a telescope.</p>

<p>Being all in the same plane, they form a
flat, broad, thin ring, so thin that when the
edge of the ring is turned toward us we cannot
see them at all. We never see them at
their full breadth. If we did, Saturn would
be much brighter at times than he ever is.
The plane in which they revolve is the plane
of Saturn’s equator; and the axis of Saturn,
with the rings, has a tilt of twenty-seven
degrees in his orbit. The result of this is<span class="pagenum" title="221"><a name="Page_221" id="Page_221"></a></span>
that at the time of Saturn’s equinoxes the
edge of the rings is turned toward us, and
they practically disappear. Half-way between
the equinoxes they are open again as
far as they ever are to our view. This is
why Saturn alternates in brightness. The
times of his equinoxes occur every fourteen
and eight-tenths years, and he is then alternately
in Leo and Aquarius and is least
bright. The times at which the rings are
most open occur at intervals of the same
length, and he is then alternately in Scorpio
and Taurus and at his brightest.</p>

<p class="tac">Photographed at Mt. Wilson by E.&nbsp;E. Barnard, the six exposures being made on one plate.</p></div>
</div>

<p>It is believed that Saturn’s rings were
never a part of the planet, but are mere
particles of cosmic materials which happened
to be left over, and which he has gathered
up by his force of gravity and compelled to
revolve about him.</p>

<p>Saturn, more fortunate than Jupiter, has
escaped the unimaginative naming of his
moons by number, though one would think
that, having such a numerous offspring, a
shortage in names would be more likely to
occur in his than in any other planet family.
They all have names more or less connected
with the great god whose name the planet
bears, and are, in order of their distance<span class="pagenum" title="222"><a name="Page_222" id="Page_222"></a></span>
from Saturn: Mimas, Enceladus, Tethys,
Dione, Rhea, Titan, Hyperion, Japetus,
Phœbe, and Themis. The largest and
brightest of them all is Titan. It is larger
than our moon, which is one of the large
moons in the solar system, or than Mercury,
and is not much smaller than Mars. It is
more than three-quarters as large as all the
other moons of Saturn put together. Naturally,
it was the first to be discovered, and
was under observation as long ago as 1655.
Rhea and Japetus are next in size, and were
discovered in 1671–72; Dione and Tethys
were both discovered in 1684, and Enceladus
and Mimas in 1789.</p>

<p>Until 1848 seven moons were all that were
known to belong to Saturn. In that year
little Hyperion, whose diameter, it is thought,
can hardly exceed two hundred miles, came
into our view. A little more than fifty years
later (in 1898) Phœbe made her bright mark
on a photographic plate at Harvard, and
was caught. By tracing her from one plate
to another her orbit was computed, her
probable size determined, and practically all
that is known about her was found out before
she was seen, which was not until 1904.
She is not much larger than a good-sized<span class="pagenum" title="223"><a name="Page_223" id="Page_223"></a></span>
mountain, but is a unique and interesting
little satellite that, far outside of the paths
of any of the other moons, circles in an eccentric
orbit around Saturn in an opposite
direction from the rest of the satellites, and
thus gives rise to many interesting astronomical
speculations. Themis, also a tiny
body, was discovered in the same way in
1906, and is thought to be the smallest body
in the solar system. Titan is the only one
of this group of satellites whose true disc
we can see even with a telescope. Only one
other (Rhea) can be seen in transit across
the planet. The others are not much more
than bright points of light, while Phœbe and
Themis are almost at the limit of visibility.</p>

<p>On account of their great distance from
the sun Saturn’s moons are, of course, not
very bright, and all of them put together do
not give one-tenth as much light to Saturn
as we receive from our moon. But, such as
they are, they may some day be very useful
to Saturn as a means of illumination. Receiving
as he does a hundred times less light
from the sun than we do, he may be some
day much in need of the light reflected from
all his rings and moons.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" title="224"><a name="Page_224" id="Page_224"></a></span></p>


<h3>SEASONS</h3>

<p>The seasons on Saturn are somewhat like
ours in the succession of spring, summer,
autumn, and winter; but the inclination of
its axis to its orbit being twenty-seven degrees
instead of twenty-three and a half, as
ours is, each season is much more accentuated
than ours. The sun climbs higher during
the northern summer, and sinks correspondingly
lower during the winter. But in
length Saturn’s seasons are very different
from ours. Like his year, they are about
twenty-nine and one-half times as long as
ours. Each one is more than seven years
long. Even the agreeable seasons might
grow monotonous to one in that time; but
to be spinning through the rapidly alternating
days and nights of Saturn during seven
long years of winter is a situation that one
does not care to contemplate. It is with
world personalities as with human personalities:
however much we may admire
their superior grandeur, when we consider
details we would not change places with them.</p>

<p>The symbol of Saturn is an ancient scythe
(♄), which gets its appropriateness from
the fact that the deity of that name was the
special protector of agriculture.</p>

<h2>XV</h2>

<h3>URANUS</h3>


<p>Venus, Mars, Jupiter, and Saturn, brilliant
beauties that they are, have always
been distinguished features of the
heavenly view. The records of Mercury do
not go back so far as those of these more
easily seen planets, yet there is no reason
to think that he has not been always known,
though less widely, perhaps, than the four
planets more frequently in view. To Uranus
belongs the distinction of being the first
planet that was <i>discovered</i>&mdash;a distinction
that one cannot help but feel was too long
delayed, for it did not come until 1781. For
ages and ages his lovely pale beams had been
shining down upon us from his little disc,
no fainter in brilliancy than many a sixth-magnitude
star (a degree of brightness which
we think is within the limit of good vision,
even in these days), and no human being had
been conscious that this bright body was<span class="pagenum" title="226"><a name="Page_226" id="Page_226"></a></span>
only another member of the solar family,
circling with the rest of us around our parent,
the sun, and having nothing in common with
the far-off stars among which we had numbered
him. Nineteen times he had been
charted as a fixed star before his identity
was suspected, and after he became known
to us as a planet he was, by means of these
charts, traced back for one hundred and
thirty years, and much information was
thus gained concerning his orbit and movements.</p>

<p>Uranus was not, however, discovered
through observation of his movement among
the stars. A view of his actual disc was
caught by the musician and astronomer,
Herschel, as he gleaned with his telescope
in that part of the sky where the planet
lay, one hundred and seventy-one years after
the invention of that aid to vision. It was
at first thought that a comet had been discovered,
but later investigation showed a
much more important member of the solar
system, and the discovery of a new planet
was announced.</p>

<p>George III. was then King of England,
and the loyal Herschel called the planet
<i>Georgium Sidus</i> in honor of that monarch.<span class="pagenum" title="227"><a name="Page_227" id="Page_227"></a></span>
Fortunately, the world-wide interest in this
newly discovered body saved it from so
local an appellation, and it finally came to be
called after Uranus, the father of Saturn, a
name somewhat more in keeping with its
place among the planets. In England, however,
a very commendable loyalty to Herschel
has resulted in the planet’s sometimes
being called Herschel, after its discoverer,
and we see this name often in English books
on astronomy, especially the older books;
but Uranus is now the generally accepted
name.</p>

<p>The symbol of the planet as it appears in
all almanacs&mdash;at least in all English almanacs&mdash;is
a capital H with a planet swinging from
the cross-bar in the letter, thus ♅. And to
this extent the discovery of the planet by
Herschel is commemorated. In American
almanacs the symbol is contracted into this
figure ♅.</p>

<p>It is a matter for regret that Uranus does
not come more easily within our view; for
he is a very beautiful planet, pale green in
color, and unlike any of the others in his
aspect. There are, however, very few persons
nowadays who can see him without the
aid of at least a small glass, and to most of<span class="pagenum" title="228"><a name="Page_228" id="Page_228"></a></span>
us he must ever remain a body with which
we can have no personal acquaintance.
None the less he must have an interest to
us such as attaches always to anything so
closely related to us, and sharing with us a
common origin and a common destiny. To
those who have unusually keen vision&mdash;or a
small telescope&mdash;there will be much pleasure
in viewing the planet. But even to those
who have not these facilities for seeing, it
ought to be interesting to know in what
region of the skies this far-off member of
our family dwells, what his wanderings are,
and something of his personality and habits.</p>

<p>It requires a few days more than eighty-four
years for Uranus to make one revolution
around the sun, so that he moves even more
slowly than Saturn from one constellation
to another; and if we could only see him
more easily, he would be scarcely more difficult
to keep track of than a fixed star. He
remains in each constellation somewhere
near seven years and his change of place
in the skies amounts in one year to but little
more than four degrees, which is less than
the distance between the pointers.</p>

<p>Since Uranus was discovered he has made
one circuit of the skies, which he finished in<span class="pagenum" title="229"><a name="Page_229" id="Page_229"></a></span>
1865, and he is now (1912) more than half-way
around on another. His position now
is in Capricornus, nearly twenty degrees east
of the “milk dipper” in Sagittarius, and for
the next quarter of a century he can be seen
by any who have eyes, or a glass, to accomplish
this during the summer evenings. Each
year he will be about seven degrees farther
east. He is, however, still pretty far south
of the equator, and not so easily seen as he
will be when he reaches that part of the
ecliptic which runs somewhat higher in the
skies. Even an opera-glass will bring Uranus
into the view of many persons. His path
deviates very little from the line of the
ecliptic&mdash;never quite so much as half a degree.
The knowledge of this makes it less
difficult to find him.</p>

<p>The synodic period of Uranus is about
three hundred and sixty-nine days, so that
an opposition occurs about four or five days
later each year. He was in opposition this
year (1912) on July 24th. In 1913 an opposition
will take place on July 29th, and in 1914
on August 2d, and oppositions will occur
about four days later each year thereafter.</p>

<p>Uranus is twice as far from the sun as<span class="pagenum" title="230"><a name="Page_230" id="Page_230"></a></span>
Saturn is, and nineteen times as far as the
earth. Its mean distance from the sun is
1,784,732,000 miles, and at this distance
more than two hours and a half would be
required for light to travel from the sun to
the planet. Viewed from the planet, the
sun would appear only about two and a half
times larger than Jupiter appears to us, and
the earth would be a very small telescopic
body, if, indeed, it would be visible at all.
Even at this great distance from the sun, and
with the sun showing so small as it does, the
planet would still have more than a thousand
times as much light as we get from our moon,
and so in this respect might be fairly comfortably
provided for even for eyes constructed
like those of human beings. The
heat the sun’s radiant energy furnishes to
Uranus is, from our point of view, almost a
negligible quantity. If there were no other
source of supply, the normal temperature of
the planet would be more than three hundred
degrees below zero, Fahrenheit. There is no
reason to think, however, that this is the temperature
that prevails on Uranus. As far
as we can tell, it has a dense and extensive
atmosphere, and probably very considerable
internal heat.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" title="231"><a name="Page_231" id="Page_231"></a></span></p>

<p>Uranus is smaller than either Jupiter or
Saturn; but it is much larger than Mars,
Venus, Mercury and the earth combined.
Its diameter is nearly thirty-three thousand
miles. Its volume is sixty-five times as
great as that of the earth; but its mass is
only about fourteen times the mass of the
earth, which shows it to be a very much
expanded body. It is slightly more dense
than water, but only about two-tenths as
dense as the earth. Its force of gravity is
small for so large a body&mdash;only about nine-tenths
that of the earth.</p>

<p>There is every indication that the planet
is not a solid body at all, and that it is, perhaps,
largely vapor. We undoubtedly cannot
see the surface of it; but through the
telescope it faintly shows the same belted
appearance that we see on Jupiter and
on Saturn, though it is difficult to see the
belted region, which is near the equator, because
the axis of the planet is so inclined to
its orbit that much of the time the poles are
pointed almost toward us. The spectroscope
indicates something of the same materials in
its atmosphere that the other large and faraway
planets have, and there is no reason to
doubt that the planet is in a much earlier<span class="pagenum" title="232"><a name="Page_232" id="Page_232"></a></span>
stage of development than any of the terrestrial
planets.</p>

<p>We really know nothing certainly about
the rotation of Uranus; but there seems to
be some indication that, like Jupiter and
Saturn, it revolves swiftly&mdash;in perhaps ten
or twelve hours, and hence has a very short
day and night. The great inclination of
its axis must make its seasons so abnormal,
from our point of view, that it is difficult to
understand what they are. Moreover, the
planet is, at this stage of its development,
so far from being a habitable body, for
beings such as we know anything about,
that the subject of its seasons seems not
very important or interesting.</p>

<p>It seems but fitting that this vapory, pale
green planet should have satellites with the
fairy names of Ariel, Umbriel, Titania, and
Oberon. One can forgive a good many
utilitarian feats in nomenclature for the sake
of these charmingly appropriate names for
the satellites of Uranus. Titania and Oberon
were discovered in 1787 by Herschel, the
discoverer of the planet. They are not very
much farther from Uranus than our moon
is from us, and are easily seen with a telescope.
Titania, the nearer to Uranus and<span class="pagenum" title="233"><a name="Page_233" id="Page_233"></a></span>
the larger, is probably about one thousand
miles in diameter; and Oberon is not very
much smaller. In 1852 Umbriel and Ariel
were discovered. They are both smaller and
nearer to Uranus than either of the two first
discovered, and are seen with considerable
difficulty, because of their proximity to the
larger and brighter body of the planet.
There is not, however, very much difference
between any of the four in real brightness.</p>

<h2>XVI</h2>

<h3>NEPTUNE</h3>


<p>It is rather curious to what extent we have
a feeling of kinship with Neptune, notwithstanding
he dwells forever in far-off
space where we cannot expect even to have
a glimpse of him without the aid of a telescope.
Uranus, the other very distant planet,
is so nearly within the limit of ordinary
vision that we have always a hope that, by
some lucky chance of situation or atmosphere,
we may some day be able to see him
face to face, and know for ourselves what
manner of planet this is which, though a
member of our own cosmic family, remains
always just beyond easy exchange of glances
with us; and so we in a measure keep a lookout
for him that gives us a sense of his reality.</p>

<p>With Neptune there can be no feeling of
this sort to keep us with a lively interest in
him, and yet he is hardly less real to us than
Uranus, and we have a more intimate sense<span class="pagenum" title="235"><a name="Page_235" id="Page_235"></a></span>
of nearness to him than we have for any
fixed star. Far away as he is, the distance
between us is short compared with the many
trillions of miles farther that we must go
to reach the nearest star, and in thinking
of him we always have a sense of this. Then,
however aloof he may keep himself from this
cozy little bunch of planets near the sun, of
which the earth is one, he is still of the same
parentage with us, and his life history is
part of our family history, so that we can
never feel indifferent to what concerns him.</p>

<p>Close as Neptune is to us in kinship and
distance, as astronomical distances go, we
never knew of his existence until sixty-six
years ago. He is to us almost a recent
arrival in the solar domain, but we know
that he has been here as long as we have;
and whether he was detached before we were
from the great nebula which gave birth to
us all, or at about the same time, we know
that for long ages before there were eyes
on the earth to see him he was, as he still
is, circling slowly and majestically around
our common center of control.</p>

<p>The discovery of Neptune in 1846 created
truly a sensation in astronomical circles.
And, unlike most sensational happenings, it<span class="pagenum" title="236"><a name="Page_236" id="Page_236"></a></span>
fully justified the extreme interest it aroused.
The computation that led to it was a mathematical
triumph, and the final result was a
most splendidly convincing proof of the
theory of gravitation. For the place of this
hitherto unknown planet was found by
means of computations based on the fact
that at certain times Uranus went a little
out of his way, thus showing some disturbing
body outside of his orbit pulling him
slightly from the course he would otherwise
take. The deviation was not much&mdash;only
about one and three-fourths of a minute,
which is equal to about one-seventeenth of
the apparent diameter of the moon, or one-sixth
of the distance between Mizar and
Alcor, situated at the bend of the handle of
the Big Dipper, two stars that it is difficult
for some eyes to separate.<a id="FNanchor_7" href="#Footnote_7" class="fnanchor">7</a> But this slight
irregularity of Uranus was enough to set at
least two able men at work in an effort to
locate the disturbing cause. These two men
were Adams, of England, and Leverrier, of
France.</p>

<p>The result of Adams’s work was announced
to the Astronomer Royal in England in the<span class="pagenum" title="237"><a name="Page_237" id="Page_237"></a></span>
autumn of 1845; but the actual search for
the planet in the place predicted was delayed
until the following summer. In the mean
time Leverrier had completed his work and
had communicated with astronomers in Berlin,
directing them where to look for the
planet. The facilities for that sort of work
were then better in Berlin than in England;
and within half an hour after the search
was begun, on the night of September 23,
1846, the new planet was discovered a little
more than half a degree from the exact
position Leverrier had found for it. It was
first recognized as having a sensible disc,
and within a day its motion was apparent.
No wonder the astronomical world was
thrilled by this achievement!</p>

<p>Although the planet was actually discovered
by following the directions of Leverrier,
it was found that it might have been
seen months before if the English astronomers
had shown more promptness in using
the computations of Adams; and there has
always been a disposition among astronomers,
both in France and in England, to give
both men credit for their extraordinary
achievement, though, naturally, there is
somewhat more stress laid upon the work of<span class="pagenum" title="238"><a name="Page_238" id="Page_238"></a></span>
each in his own country. The newly discovered
body was at first named for its discoverer,
Leverrier, but a sense of justice
to Adams prevailed to such an extent that
in the end a less commemorative name was
chosen, and the planet was called after
Neptune, the son of Saturn and the brother
of Jupiter&mdash;a name more fitting, on the whole,
for a member of this planet family, whose
other members all bear the names of some of
the ancient deities. The trident (♆), Neptune’s
three-pronged spear, is the symbol
of the planet.</p>

<p>The mean distance of Neptune from the
sun is more than two and a half billion miles
(2,790,000,000), and his orbit is so nearly
circular that the variation between his perihelion
and aphelion distance is only about
fifty million miles. His orbit is, in fact, less
eccentric than that of any other planet except
Venus. His immense distance from the
sun, of course, deprives him of any great
amount of heat or light from that source
as compared with the other planets. The
sun would appear to an observer on Neptune
a little smaller than Venus appears to us.
But so great is the intensity of its radiance
that even as so diminutive a sun as<span class="pagenum" title="239"><a name="Page_239" id="Page_239"></a></span>
that it would give to Neptune more than
six hundred times as much light as our full
moon gives to us. This, however, would
be as much as nine hundred times less light
than we get from the sun. Such light as the
planet receives from the sun reaches it after
a journey of a little more than four hours.</p>

<p>Of the heat the planet has, either inherent
or acquired from the sun, we do not know
much. The normal temperature at that
distance from the sun would be more than
three hundred and sixty degrees below zero,
Fahrenheit, and there is not much to indicate
in what state the planet is with reference
to its own heat. Investigations thus
far made do not show it to be so intensely
hot as Jupiter and Saturn undoubtedly are;
but with its heavily vapor-laden atmosphere
it could not have the frigidity normal to a
black, unprotected body at its distance from
the sun.</p>

<p>Neptune is thought to have an immense
atmosphere, and, like the other outer planets,
one of a composition not wholly familiar to
us. Consequently we do not know as yet
just what this atmosphere does for the
planet. It has a fairly good reflecting power,
though the planet, on the whole, is darker<span class="pagenum" title="240"><a name="Page_240" id="Page_240"></a></span>
in color than Jupiter or Saturn. Its color
is of that bluish cast which sometimes suggests
a leaden appearance. The color, as
well as the fact that Neptune is denser than
any of the other outer planets, indicates that
it may be in a more advanced stage of development
than at least Jupiter and Saturn
are, and perhaps than Uranus is.</p>

<p>That Neptune has made greater progress
toward solidity (though it is still very far
from that state) than the other outer planets
is suggested also by its size; for, as we have
seen, the smaller planets develop more rapidly
than the larger ones. The diameter of
Neptune is a little less than thirty thousand
(29,827) miles. The planet is somewhat
smaller, therefore, than Uranus, and much
smaller than Jupiter or Saturn. But as
compared with the earth, the largest of the
inner planets, it is a vastly greater body.
Its mass is seventeen times more than that
of the earth; its surface is as much as sixteen
times more extensive than the earth’s;
and its volume is more than eighty times
greater than the volume of the earth.</p>

<p>Of the time of Neptune’s rotation on its
axis very little is known. That little, however,
indicates a slower rotation than the<span class="pagenum" title="241"><a name="Page_241" id="Page_241"></a></span>
other planets seem to have, and the alternations
of day and night on Neptune are, therefore,
probably less swift than on Jupiter and
on Saturn. The planet is too far away for
us to see its surface markings with any distinctness,
but there are indirect processes
by which we can get approximate information
concerning the facts about rotation.
One of these processes is by observation of
the motions of the satellites. Of these useful
bodies Neptune, fortunately, has one&mdash;a
very excellent moon about the size of our
own. It has some eccentricities, such as
revolving about the planet in the opposite
direction from that which the more conventional
satellites follow, and having an orbit
a good deal inclined to the plane of the
equator of the parent body. But it is a very
interesting moon to astronomers, and will
no doubt in time help to make clear some
things in the history of Neptune which are
now not quite understood.</p>

<p>Being so far from the sun, Neptune moves,
of course, very slowly in comparison with
the nearer planets, though his speed is at
the rate of three and a half miles a second,
which, after all, does not denote any high
degree of sluggishness. His change of posi<span class="pagenum" title="242"><a name="Page_242" id="Page_242"></a></span>tion
in the sky amounts to a little more than
two degrees a year; so that in an ordinary
lifetime he does not make any very great
progress along the zodiac.</p>

<p>When Neptune was discovered he had just
left the constellation Capricornus, and in the
sixty-six years that his movements have been
followed he has passed through Aquarius,
Pisces, Aries, Taurus, and is now (1912) in
Gemini, very near Castor and Pollux. The
time required for his circuit around the sun
is nearly one hundred and sixty-five (164.6)
years, so that he remains for about thirteen
years in each constellation. He will
complete one sidereal period, dating from
the time of his discovery, in the year
2011.</p>

<p>The apparent motion of Neptune is direct
a little more than six months in the year, and
retrograde a little more than five months, so
that it seems to present the old mental arithmetic
problem of the climber that fell back
so much every time after he had climbed
a certain number of feet. But the falling
back in the case of Neptune is an illusion,
as we know. He keeps straight on in his
journey, as we may see if we watch him
from year to year, and his change of position<span class="pagenum" title="243"><a name="Page_243" id="Page_243"></a></span>
is so slight during any year that the change
of direction is hardly noticeable.</p>

<p>Neptune is as bright as an eighth-magnitude
star, and it is possible to see him with
a good field-glass. The difficulty is in distinguishing
him from a star, for his disc does
not show except through a telescope. If one
has such a glass, however, it will be worth
while to direct it toward that part of the
ecliptic just under Castor and Pollux any
time within the next two or three years, and
a sight of this yet strange brother planet
may be the reward. He will be in opposition
on January 14, 1913, and thereafter
about two days later each year.</p>

<h2>XVII</h2>

<h3>THE LITTLE PLANETS, OR THE ASTEROIDS</h3>


<p>The asteroids, or minor planets, are
situated almost wholly in the vast space
between Mars and Jupiter. Their orbits are
very irregular, both as to shape and situation;
but, so far as is known, only two of
them pass beyond the orbit of Jupiter, and
only one has been discovered which at any
point in its journey around the sun comes
nearer than the orbit of Mars.</p>

<p>The minor planets are called by astronomers
almost indifferently asteroids or planetoids.
“Asteroids” is probably the name by
which they are most popularly known.
But because they are in fact simply little
bodies that revolve about the sun as the
planets do, “planetoids” seems to be more
truly descriptive of them, and it is the word
I have chosen to use here.</p>

<p>It was early noted that, except in one instance,
the planets seemed to show in their<span class="pagenum" title="245"><a name="Page_245" id="Page_245"></a></span>
distance from the sun something like a
mathematical progression. Struck by this appearance,
an astronomer named Bode worked
it out into a formula, known ever since as
Bode’s law, though the idea seems to have
originated with another astronomer. One
almost always sees it mentioned in any work
dealing with this phase of planetary history,
and it is especially interesting because of the
part it played in the discovery of the planetoids.
It was as follows: Beginning with nothing
for Mercury, add three for Venus, twice
three, or six, for the earth, twelve for Mars,
and continue thus to double the number for
each planet out to and including Saturn.
Then to each one of the numbers so obtained
add four, and the numbers resulting will very
nearly represent the relative distances of
the planets from the sun. Thus:</p>


<div class="center">
<table border="0" cellpadding="2" cellspacing="0" summary="">
<tr><td class="tar pl1">0</td><td class="tar pl1">3</td><td class="tar pl1">6</td><td class="tar pl1">12</td><td class="tar pl1">24</td><td class="tar pl1">48</td><td class="tar pl1">96</td><td class="tar pl1">192</td><td class="tar pl1">384</td></tr>
<tr class="bb"><td class="tar pl1">4</td><td class="tar pl1">4</td><td class="tar pl1">4</td><td class="tar pl1">4</td><td class="tar pl1">4</td><td class="tar pl1">4</td><td class="tar pl1">4</td><td class="tar pl1">4</td><td class="tar pl1">4</td></tr>

</table></div>

<p>The exception was that at the fifth number,
28, there was no planet to correspond, and
Jupiter was nearly twice as far away from
Mars as it should have been to conform to<span class="pagenum" title="246"><a name="Page_246" id="Page_246"></a></span>
the law, thus leaving room for another planet
to occupy the allotted position and fill out
this very beautiful progression.</p>

<p>About nine years after this law was set
forth Uranus was discovered circling out
in space far beyond Saturn, and was found
to conform to the law in a most satisfactory
manner, its distance being approximately
twice that of Saturn. With such close accord
between the actual distances and the
prescribed distances of the planets from the
sun, and with the one exception leaving almost
exactly the space allotted by Bode’s
law for another planet, astronomers naturally
had a very strong feeling that there must
be another planet between Mars and Jupiter.
They accordingly set to work to prove
this, if possible, and to find what had become
of this lost member of the planet
family, if it ever existed.</p>

<p>As a result of this work, on January 1,
1801, the first planetoid was discovered, and
in rapid succession many like it were found,
until now many hundreds are known to
astronomers. Their discovery seemed at
first almost a certain confirmation of Bode’s
law, and the fact that where one large planet
should have been found there proved to be<span class="pagenum" title="247"><a name="Page_247" id="Page_247"></a></span>
such a swarm of small ones could be accounted
for in no other way than to suppose
that something had happened in the making
of the planet. At any rate, the promulgation
of Bode’s law was the direct cause of the
search for the missing planet which led to
the discovery of the planetoids. And this is
the only reason why Bode’s law has continued
to be mentioned in the history of the planets.
For it was no real law, it had no scientific
foundation, and its conformity to the facts
of the relative distances of the planets was
only one of those very interesting and singular
coincidences that startle one for the
moment into thinking that there is some
scientific significance in them. Another example
of such a coincidence is in the fact
that the mass of any given planet exceeds
the total mass of all the planets of any less
mass than itself.</p>

<p>In less than half a century after the discovery
of the first planetoid, Neptune was
discovered at a distance not at all corresponding
to that indicated by Bode’s law.
It was not nearly far enough away, and yet,
strangely enough, it was by taking Bode’s
law into consideration that the position was
indicated which finally led to the discovery<span class="pagenum" title="248"><a name="Page_248" id="Page_248"></a></span>
of the planet. So while Bode’s law has been
found to be no law at all, it is, nevertheless,
entitled to some mention because of its having
thus stimulated research that has had
such important results.</p>

<p>No really satisfactory and final explanation
of the present state of the planetoids
has ever been given. At one time it was
suggested that another planet had originally
existed in the space between Mars and
Jupiter, and through some catastrophe had
been shattered into the small bodies that
now occupy that space. But this has been
shown to be impossible.</p>

<p>It is now thought probable that in the
original nebula the matter forming the
planetoids might have been prevented from
condensing into a planet by the powerful
gravitative influence of Jupiter. This influence,
however, was not sufficiently strong
to bring them entirely under his control.
Even yet he pulls some of them five or six
degrees out of the path they otherwise would
take when they venture within the limits
of his domain; but he does not capture
them, so they have been left to circle around
the sun as mere fragments of bodies, with
no force to combine and make a world, no<span class="pagenum" title="249"><a name="Page_249" id="Page_249"></a></span>
mass to hold an atmosphere, and with nothing
to prevent them from quickly condensing
and from radiating all their heat into space.
They are, in the main, just cold, dark, lifeless
rocks and lumps of matter whirling
through space in a maze of interlacing orbits,
some of them almost as far from the sun as
Jupiter and some almost as near as Mars&mdash;one,
indeed, a little nearer than Mars at
certain times&mdash;but most of them swarming
more thickly about half-way between Mars
and Jupiter, not far from the place that
Bode’s law assigned to a planet.</p>

<p>After the first planetoid was discovered and
had been observed for a few weeks, it was
lost and had to be rediscovered by means
of mathematical computation of its orbit.
Where this computation showed that it
ought to be, there it was found, on the very
last day of the same year, 1801. Early the
next year another body of the same sort was
discovered, two years later another was
found, and still three years later a fourth
came into view. These four were the only
ones known in this branch of the solar family
for nearly forty years thereafter.</p>

<p>In 1845 another period of discovery commenced,
and has ever since continued, until<span class="pagenum" title="250"><a name="Page_250" id="Page_250"></a></span>
there are now between six and seven hundred
of these little bodies that have disclosed
their right to be known as members
of the sun’s family. It is probable that
there may be still many more of them, since
a new one comes to light every now and
then on a photographic plate, and there is
no indication of any limit to the number that
may thus appear.</p>

<p>It is likely that about all have been discovered
that can be seen even with a telescope,
for a fairly systematic and thorough
search has been made of the heavens for
this purpose during the last half-century.
This work has resulted in a continually decreasing
number of discoveries, until this
method of search has finally been practically
abandoned. But it not infrequently happens
that in photographing the stars a little
trail of light is discovered on the plate,
showing that some heavenly body with sensible
motion has been caught on it. And
this usually proves to be a new planetoid.
No matter how long a photographic plate is
exposed, the fixed stars imprint themselves
on it only as points of light. When the
impression is a little streak of light instead
of a dot, the object is shown to be in motion,<span class="pagenum" title="251"><a name="Page_251" id="Page_251"></a></span>
and is either a planetoid, a satellite, or a
comet. The fixed stars would make a trail
also if the photographic apparatus were not
regulated by clockwork, so as to follow the
star in its apparent daily motion across the
skies. The planets and other bodies in the
solar system are sufficiently near to have
a sensible motion in addition to the motion
caused by the rotation of the earth, which is
the only motion we have to take into account
in dealing with the aspects of the
stars.</p>

<p>The first planetoid discovered was called
Ceres, the next one Pallas, the third Juno,
and the fourth Vesta. This pretty custom
of naming them after the gods and goddesses
of mythology was continued, with some
variations, until perhaps three hundred had
been so christened. But the number of them
became too prodigious; and when so many
began to swarm into view, waiting to be
named, the utilitarian method of designating
them simply by numbers in the order
of their discovery was adopted. The only
distinguishing feature of so numbering them
is that each number is placed in a little
circle. Thus Ceres is ①, Pallas ②, and so
on. Those of them that have any special<span class="pagenum" title="252"><a name="Page_252" id="Page_252"></a></span>
claim to distinction, however, are still referred
to by their own names, if they have
any, in spite of this most orderly attempt to
make them fit for easy reference in a list.</p>

<p>There are so many of the planetoids, and
they are so minute, that even after they have
been discovered they are frequently lost
again. Hence it is sometimes uncertain
when they register themselves on the photographic
plates whether they are really new
to us or have been known before. In such
cases they are named temporarily after the
letters of the alphabet, and, when the alphabet
is exhausted, a second letter is added.
Thus A to Z, then AB to AZ, BC to BZ, and
so on in a sort of “round.” Sometimes these
combinations of letters become the fixed
designation of a planetoid, as a nickname
sometimes clings to a person. And thus it
happens that we sometimes read of one in
particular of these little bodies that is conspicuous
for the great eccentricity of its
orbit, called “WD.” The letters are not its
initials, but its nickname. It really has no
name other than its number in the list; but
it became famous while it was temporarily
designated as “WD,” and thus it continues
to be called.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" title="253"><a name="Page_253" id="Page_253"></a></span></p>

<p>The aid of a telescope is necessary in order
to see the planetoids, though it is said that
Vesta, under very favorable conditions,
sometimes comes within the limit of visibility.
She is the brightest of them all,
though not the largest, and her brilliancy is
the subject of much interesting speculation
among astronomers, who have not yet been
able to account for it. She seems from her
excessive brightness to be covered with
clouds; and yet it is manifestly impossible
that so small a body could have held an
atmosphere throughout these long ages,
though clouds presuppose an atmosphere.
No doubt, in time this mystery of Vesta’s
brilliancy will be made plain. Bright as
she is in proportion to her size, and even if
she sometimes can be seen, one cannot reasonably
expect anything very brilliant to
our view from a body not much more than
a hundred miles in diameter, shining by reflected
light, nearly two hundred million
miles away.</p>

<p>Ceres, as far as we yet know, is the largest
of the planetoids, and may be something
more than four hundred miles in diameter.
Juno is somewhere near the same size. Pallas
is about two hundred miles in diameter,<span class="pagenum" title="254"><a name="Page_254" id="Page_254"></a></span>
and Vesta about one hundred and eighteen.
No doubt, these four were the first to be discovered,
because they are the largest and
so the easiest to be seen. At any rate, no
others yet seen exceed them in size, and some
of the more lately discovered are not more
than fifteen or twenty miles in diameter.
Many of those discovered by photography
are doubtless even smaller than these, and
are, perhaps, mere meteors in size. The
combined mass of all those discovered up
to this time is far smaller than that of any
of the large planets, or even than that of
our moon. Their mass cannot, of course,
really be measured, because they are too
small to have any perceptible gravitative
effect on other bodies, and mass can only
be determined by the influence of one body
on another. But we do know that their
aggregate mass, if it exceeded a certain
limit, would show some disturbing effect
on Mars; and, since it does not do this, we
know that all of them taken together would
make an extremely insignificant body.</p>

<p>While the planetoids all revolve around
the sun in the same manner and in the same
direction as the planets do, yet they are very
erratic in their courses, and do not all keep<span class="pagenum" title="255"><a name="Page_255" id="Page_255"></a></span>
within the narrow limits of the zodiac
through which&mdash;happily for our convenient
observation&mdash;the larger bodies travel. The
orbits of many of them are extremely elliptical,
while some are almost circles; and their
inclination to the ecliptic varies from almost
nothing to nearly fifty degrees. If one
could catch from one side a view of them all
together, they would have much the appearance
in space of a flock of swallows, the individuals
darting this way and that, passing
above and below one another in such intricate
sweeps and sinuosities that it would be
impossible to keep track of them separately.
And yet time has brought these apparently
tangled orbits into such nice adjustment
that the little bodies can continue
to cross and recross each other’s paths with
no danger of interference from each other.
Such collisions as there may have been
occurred in the very beginning of their
careers. Such of them as came into collision
then traveled on together as one body
until accommodation was made for all.</p>

<p>One of the most wide-wandering of these
tiny bodies has been named Eros, after the
little god of love, more commonly known
as Cupid. It has a particular interest for<span class="pagenum" title="256"><a name="Page_256" id="Page_256"></a></span>
us, because of all the heavenly bodies it at
times comes nearer to us than any except
the moon and an occasional comet. At its
nearest it is within fourteen million miles
of the earth, which is more than ten million
miles nearer than the closest approach of
Venus, the nearest of the large planets.</p>

<p>This little body was thus near us in 1894;
but we did not then know this, for Eros was
not discovered until 1898. After its discovery,
however, it was traced back on
many photographic plates, and the fact that
it had been in our neighborhood was learned.
For untold ages it has been making these
visits to us every thirty-seven years, and we
have known nothing of them. Its next near
approach will be in 1931, and it will continue
to come thereafter every thirty-seven years.
Now that we know about them, these visits
are not only pleasant to contemplate, but
it is expected that when they occur the
planetoid will be of great scientific value to
us in helping to determine more surely and
accurately the exact distance of the sun.</p>

<p>The planetoids, though so minute and of
no value as a spectacle, have been, and still
are, very useful little bodies to us in a scientific
way. In addition to furnishing an easy<span class="pagenum" title="257"><a name="Page_257" id="Page_257"></a></span>
means of measuring the distance of the sun,
they promise to throw some light on various
questions of physics in which the planets,
too, are involved. The brilliancy of Vesta,
for instance, which has been mentioned, and
the unaccountable variability in the brightness
of some others of them have yet to be
adjusted to known physical laws. Even the
extreme eccentricity of some of their orbits,
and the large tilt of some of them to the
ecliptic, may be suggestive in finally solving
certain planetary problems, for these
impish little bodies are far from conforming
to the regular ways of the planets, and there
is, of course, some mechanical reason for
their apparent waywardness.</p>

<h2>XVIII</h2>

<h3>CONCLUSION</h3>


<p>The great variety of beauty that the
planets present to us is sufficient to
keep us always interested in them, when
once we have acquired an acquaintance with
them. Rarely is there an evening when
some one of them does not enhance the charm
of the splendid spectacle of the sky in which
all the heavenly bodies save the sun have a
part. Their greater brilliancy often brings
them into view before the stars have begun
to glow in the evening, and prolongs our
sight of them after the rays of the sun have
blotted out the light of the stars in the
morning. Thus they are always single in
their loveliness, and always hold a distinguished
place in the midst of the brilliant
company of the stars.</p>

<p>Having considered these brilliant bodies
individually and in detail, as we have, we
ought by this time to be able to identify<span class="pagenum" title="259"><a name="Page_259" id="Page_259"></a></span>
any one of them that shows itself in the
evening sky, and to have a pretty fair notion
of the general character and peculiarities of
each. But even if one does not much care for
detailed information concerning them, or,
before seeking that, prefers first to become
familiar with their appearance, a quick and
sure recognition of them may be had by
noting their positions and their very striking
individual aspects as set forth in the
preceding chapters.</p>

<p>On seeing a bright object in the sky that
does not seem to be a familiar star, simply
stop and look at it. Does it twinkle? If
it does not, it is a planet. If it is more than
forty-five degrees from the sun, or if it is
seen at a time when the sun has been down
more than three hours, then it is neither
Mercury nor Venus, and must be either
Mars, Jupiter, or Saturn. Is it very bright
and pinkish in tone? Then it is Jupiter.
Is it very bright and quite red? It is Mars,
not far from opposition. Is it not very
bright, but small and rosy? Then it is
Mars going toward conjunction. Is it yellow
in tone and, while large and conspicuous,
still not so very brilliant? It is Saturn.</p>

<p>If the planet we seek to name is nearer to<span class="pagenum" title="260"><a name="Page_260" id="Page_260"></a></span>
the sun than forty-five degrees, but is still well
above the horizon, it may be either of these
three&mdash;Mars, Jupiter, Saturn&mdash;or it is Venus.
If it is very bright and silvery, it is certainly
Venus. If it is very low in the sky and very
near the sun, it may be any one of the five
visible planets. In such a position Mars
will always be very small, and the others
always larger than a first-magnitude star;
and they may all twinkle a little&mdash;Mercury
almost as much as a star. Their size will
show them all (except Mars) as planets, but
it will be somewhat more difficult to tell
which is which than it is when they are
higher up in the sky. The best thing to do
in such circumstances is to look up their
positions either in this book or in an almanac.
The almanac will serve as a footman to
announce them. The book, it is hoped, has
so recorded their peculiarities and habits
that either their appearance or their place
will be sufficient to make them known.</p>

<p>In any event, the problem of identification
in this position will not keep one long,
for in a situation presenting these greater
difficulties the planet will be visible for less
than an hour after sundown. Besides, it
is not likely at such times to attract one’s<span class="pagenum" title="261"><a name="Page_261" id="Page_261"></a></span>
involuntary attention, but when under observation
in such a situation is usually sought
out by those already somewhat informed as
to the planet’s habits and appearance, which
will betray its identity. It is information
of this sort that I have endeavored to give
in these pages, and it is hoped that the
reading of them will be the beginning of a
long and intimate acquaintance with these
charming and always interesting individuals.</p>

<p>Individuals the planets inevitably become
to any one who learns to know them during
the long, quiet nights in the country, or
wherever an opportunity is afforded really
to contemplate their peculiar traits and features.
Like individuals of whatever kind,
they impress different persons in different
ways. As I have watched them from year
to year I have come to have a very distinct
impression of Jupiter as slow and majestic,
and yet not lacking in joviality; Saturn as
friendly, but reserved; Mars as sturdily
brisk and busy; Venus as always gracious
and smiling; and Mercury as irresponsible
and roguish. Others might have an entirely
different feeling in regard to them; but an
intimate acquaintance with them, which is<span class="pagenum" title="262"><a name="Page_262" id="Page_262"></a></span>
not wholly scientific, cannot fail to stamp
them as in some sort individuals.</p>

<p>And when we consider that these interesting
individuals are closely related members
of our cosmic family, their ever-changing
beauty of aspect, the history of their development
and their affairs generally, gain
a significance to us that no other heavenly
bodies can have. The two groups of planets&mdash;the
inner and the outer&mdash;are like two sets
of children in a family: born of the same
parent, but under very different circumstances,
and in very different surroundings.
Mars, the earth, Venus, and Mercury are all,
as compared with the outer planets, small
and dense, with more or less thin atmospheres
and an abundance of heat and light.
They all lie comparatively near to the sun,
and are composed of the denser material
lying near the center of the great nebula,
which was the original form of the entire
solar system. Probably denser to begin
with than the others, they have, on account
of their diminutive size, developed more
rapidly and are further advanced toward
the final state of solidity which we shall
all attain in the end. Mercury, the smallest,
is already old and seamed and hardened.<span class="pagenum" title="263"><a name="Page_263" id="Page_263"></a></span>
Mars, the next in size, is well advanced, but
still has an atmosphere and some other signs
of vitality. Venus, though we know so little
about her, has probably a long period
of development yet before her; while this
warm, nourishing earth, which seems to us
the best one of them all, will probably for
a still longer time than Venus hold its
atmosphere and remain green and flourishing.</p>

<p>On the other side of the vast space which
divides the two groups of the sun’s family
dwell Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus, and Neptune.
They are all tremendous in volume, enveloped
in immense atmospheres, far, far
from our common source of heat and light,
of comparatively slight density, and probably
formed from the lighter material composing
the outer edges of the parent nebula,
and, because of their immense size, still in
a very early stage of development. The
two groups could scarcely seem more widely
different if they belonged to different systems;
but the members of each are all closely akin,
and each one in its own way, determined by
its size and environment, is developing toward
the same end.</p>

<p>If there is life on any of these outer<span class="pagenum" title="264"><a name="Page_264" id="Page_264"></a></span>
planets, it must be of a sort of which we
have no conception. Jupiter and Saturn
are probably red-hot, and could sustain
nothing more cold-blooded than a race of
salamanders, though why a race of intelligent
salamanders should or should not exist
there, is a question that one might make bold
to answer according to one’s fancy. Uranus
and Neptune are smaller, and perhaps less
hot than Jupiter and Saturn; but we really
know very little about the state of their
domestic affairs, and the little we do know
in no way indicates a place of abode for any
sort of intelligence conceivable to us. We
can, however, conceive of a time in the far-distant
ages when these four hot and vaporous
planets may have become sufficiently
condensed to have a solid crust, and yet have
sufficient internal heat to moderate the frigid
temperature that would be normal at their
distance from the sun, and they might
then support life even somewhat resembling
and perhaps even more gloriously beautiful
than that with which we are familiar.</p>

<p>Of the existence of life somewhat similar
to ours on the smaller, near-by planets we
may have something nearer a reasonable con<span class="pagenum" title="265"><a name="Page_265" id="Page_265"></a></span>ception,
though we are nowhere near the
possession of any real knowledge concerning
it. Mercury, we have every reason to think,
cannot support life, mainly because of his
lack of atmosphere; but also because of his
long rotation, which affords no alternations
of day and night, but leaves him with one
side always burning-hot and the other inconceivably
cold. Venus might very well
have a climate not utterly unlike ours, and
hence be habitable for beings somewhat resembling
us, if she has, as she has long been
thought to have, a heavier atmosphere than
the earth has, and if she has alternations of
day and night. But we have seen that, owing
to the obscurity of the surface of Venus, our
knowledge in regard to these conditions is
far from certain, and we have little reason
to have even speculative ideas concerning
life there. With Mars it is a more open
question. We can see that planet, and see
it fairly well. It has an atmosphere and
changes of seasons, and while it may not
afford a climate that would be exactly attractive
to us as a place of transmigration, it
is not particularly unreasonable to let our
fancy play over the rather pleasant speculation
concerning the presence there of beings<span class="pagenum" title="266"><a name="Page_266" id="Page_266"></a></span>
at least understandable by us, even if not
wholly congenial.</p>

<p>Whatever each planet affords in the way
of life and human interests, all of them must
ever be to us the most interesting things in
all nature, outside of our own earth, in the
two regards already pointed out: first, as
the most beautiful objects of vision among
all the starry hosts, and, second, as our nearest
kindred in this universe of suns and
systems of worlds. Together the earth and
they circle ceaselessly around and around
the sun, following in nicely adjusted orbits
that great luminary as it sweeps majestically
on through space toward the beautiful Vega,
itself a sun, and, so far as we now know, in
this close companionship we shall continue
until every planet and the sun itself has become
cold and dark and lifeless. And then,
perhaps, or even before the light of our
system is finally extinguished, we may meet
another wandering sun, and in the marriage
of the two great bodies another system
of worlds may be evolved of which we and
the planets shall form a part.</p>

For those who find rhymes an aid to memory, the following
list may prove useful:
</p>

<p>
This is the way the spring begins:<br />
First Aries, then Taurus, then the Heavenly Twins.<br />
The first summer sign is the one we call Cancer;<br />
The next two to Leo and Virgo will answer.<br />
Then autumn brings Libra and bright Scorpio,<br />
And next Sagittarius, with his strong bow.<br />
Capricornus then ushers the winter in,<br />
And near old Aquarius the year we begin.<br />
Pisces comes next, and then winter is done;<br />
And with Aries’s approach, a new spring is begun.<br />
These are the <i>signs</i>; but bear this well in mind:<br />
The sun lags in one constellation behind.<br />
When his place is Aries, we’ll find him in Pisces;<br />
When in Taurus he should be, in Aries he stays.<br />
If Gemini’s his place, and to find him our wish is,<br />
We must look back in Taurus to see his bright rays.<br />
And so through the year, whatever his place is,<br />
The bright group behind is the one that he graces.

so the Foundation (and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United
States without permission and without paying copyright
royalties. Special rules, set forth in the General Terms of Use part
of this license, apply to copying and distributing Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works to protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm
concept and trademark. Project Gutenberg is a registered trademark,
and may not be used if you charge for the eBooks, unless you receive
specific permission. If you do not charge anything for copies of this
eBook, complying with the rules is very easy. You may use this eBook
for nearly any purpose such as creation of derivative works, reports,
performances and research. They may be modified and printed and given
away--you may do practically ANYTHING in the United States with eBooks
not protected by U.S. copyright law. Redistribution is subject to the
trademark license, especially commercial redistribution.

PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK

To protect the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting the free

(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full
Project Gutenberg-tm License available with this file or online at
www.gutenberg.org/license.

Section 1. General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works

1.A. By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement. If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or
destroy all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your
possession. If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a
Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound
by the terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the
person or entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph
1.E.8.

1.B. "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark. It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement. There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement. See
paragraph 1.C below. There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this
agreement and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works. See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C. The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the
Foundation" or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection
of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works. Nearly all the individual
works in the collection are in the public domain in the United
States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg-tm License when
you share it without charge with others.

1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work. Copyright laws in most countries are
in a constant state of change. If you are outside the United States,
check the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this
agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg-tm work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any
country outside the United States.

1.E. Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1. The following sentence, with active links to, or other
immediate access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear
prominently whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work
on which the phrase "Project Gutenberg" appears, or with which the
phrase "Project Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed,
performed, viewed, copied or distributed:

  This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere in the United States and
  most other parts of the world at no cost and with almost no
  restrictions whatsoever. You may copy it, give it away or re-use it
  under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included with this
  eBook or online at www.gutenberg.org. If you are not located in the
  United States, you'll have to check the laws of the country where you
  are located before using this ebook.

1.E.2. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is
derived from texts not protected by U.S. copyright law (does not
contain a notice indicating that it is posted with permission of the
copyright holder), the work can be copied and distributed to anyone in
the United States without paying any fees or charges. If you are
redistributing or providing access to a work with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the work, you must comply
either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 or
obtain permission for the use of the work and the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.3. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any
additional terms imposed by the copyright holder. Additional terms
will be linked to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works
posted with the permission of the copyright holder found at the
beginning of this work.

1.E.4. Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

1.E.5. Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg-tm License.

1.E.6. You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including
any word processing or hypertext form. However, if you provide access
to or distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format
other than "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official
version posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site
(www.gutenberg.org), you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense
to the user, provide a copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means

Vanilla ASCII" or other form. Any alternate format must include the
full Project Gutenberg-tm License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

access to or distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
provided that

* You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
  the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
  you already use to calculate your applicable taxes. The fee is owed
  to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he has
  agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation. Royalty payments must be paid
  within 60 days following each date on which you prepare (or are
  legally required to prepare) your periodic tax returns. Royalty
  payments should be clearly marked as such and sent to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the address specified in
  Section 4, "Information about donations to the Project Gutenberg
  Literary Archive Foundation."

* You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
  you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
  does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
  License. You must require such a user to return or destroy all
  copies of the works possessed in a physical medium and discontinue
  all use of and all access to other copies of Project Gutenberg-tm
  works.

* You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of
  any money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
  electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days of
  receipt of the work.

* You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
  distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9. If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work or group of works on different terms than
are set forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing
from both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and The
Project Gutenberg Trademark LLC, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark. Contact the Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg-tm collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain "Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.

1.F.2. LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees. YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3. YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3. LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from. If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person
or entity providing it to you may choose to give you a second
opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If
the second copy is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing
without further opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4. Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS', WITH NO
OTHER WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT

1.F.5. Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of
damages. If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement
violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the
agreement shall be interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or
limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or
unenforceability of any provision of this agreement shall not void the
remaining provisions.

1.F.6. INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in
accordance with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the
production, promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, harmless from all liability, costs and expenses,
including legal fees, that arise directly or indirectly from any of
the following which you do or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this
or any Project Gutenberg-tm work, (b) alteration, modification, or
additions or deletions to any Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any
Defect you cause.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org



Section 3. Information about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation

501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the
state of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
